We need to choose 5 beer bottles from the set $ {B*1, B_2, \ldots, B*{13}} $ \\
There are $ \binom{13}{5} $ ways to choose 5 beer bottles from the set $ {B*1, B_2, \ldots, B*{13}} $ \\
We can have 0 to 6 cider bottles in the subset $ X $ \\
We take into account all possible numbers of cider bottles in $ X $ using the size of sets method: $2^6$ \\
Thus, there are $ \binom{13}{5} \cdot 2^6 $ such subsets.
