The first element in A can be mapped to any of the 13 elements in B = 13 possibilities

The second element in A can be mapped to any of the 12 remaining elements in B = 12 possibilities

The third element in A can be mapped to any of the 11 remaining elements in B = 11 possibilities

The fourth element in A can be mapped to any of the 10 remaining elements in B = 10 possibilities

The fifth element in A can be mapped to any of the 9 remaining elements in B = 9 possibilities

The sixth element in A can be mapped to any of the 8 remaining elements in B = 8 possibilities

Thus, the number of one-to-one functions is $13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8$
