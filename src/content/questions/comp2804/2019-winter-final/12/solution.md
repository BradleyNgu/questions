1. Find S

   Let S be the sample space of all possible hands of 5 cards.

   $|S| = \binom{52}{5}$

2. Find A

   Let A be the event that the hand consists of 3 Aces and 2 Queens.

   We choose 3 of the 4 Aces: $\binom{4}{3} = 4$

   We choose 2 of the 4 Queens: $\binom{4}{2} = 6$

   $|A| = 4 \cdot 6= 24$

3. Find $ \Pr(A) $

   $ \Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} $

   $ \Pr(A) = \frac{24}{\binom{52}{5}} $
