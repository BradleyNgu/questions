<ul>
<li> Let $A$ be the event that the sequence contains no $T$. 
The set of outcomes for $A$ is $(H)$. 
The probability of $A$ is $ Pr(A) = \frac{1}{2}$ since the coin has a 50% chance of landing heads.
<li> Let $B$ be the event that the sequence contains exactly one $T$. 
The set of outcomes for $B$ is $(HT)$. 
The coin has a 50% chance of landing heads followed by 50% chance of landing tails. 
The probability of $B$ is $ Pr(B) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$
	<li> Let $C$ be the event that the sequence contains exactly two $T$s. 
The set of outcomes for $C$ is $(HTT)$. 
the coin has a 50% chance of landing heads followed by two 50% chances of landing tails. 
The probability of $C$ is $ Pr(C) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}$
</ul>
The probability that the sequence contains at most two $T$s is the sum of the probabilities of events $A$, $B$, and $C$: 
$(Pr(text{at most 2} T)) $
$ = Pr(A) + Pr(B) + Pr(C) $
$ = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}$
