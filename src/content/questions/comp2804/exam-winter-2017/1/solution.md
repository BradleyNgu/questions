Well, let's break it down
<ul>
<li> We can place the first odd number in any of the 5 odd positions: 5 \\
We can place the second odd number in any of the 4 remaining odd positions: 4 \\
\ldots \\
We can place the last odd number in the last remaining odd position: 1 \\
This creates $ 5! $ permutations
<li> We can place the first even number in any of the 5 even positions: 5 \\
We can place the second even number in any of the 4 remaining even positions: 4 \\
\ldots \\
We can place the last even number in the last remaining even position: 1 \\
This creates $ 5! $ permutations
</ul>
Multiplying the two permutations, we get $ 5! \cdot 5! $
