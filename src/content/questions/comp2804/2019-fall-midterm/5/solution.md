1. Determine A

   Let A be the event that a 4 letter string starts with $ad$

   The first 2 letters are locked in place: 1 possibility

   The last 2 letters can be a, b, c or d: $4^2$ possibilities

   $|A| = 1 \cdot 4^2 = 16$

2. Determine B

   Let be the event that a 4 letter string ends with $dcb$

   The last 3 letters are locked in place: 1 possibility

   The first letter can be a or d: $4^1$ possibilities

   $|B| = 1 \cdot 4^1 = 4$

3. Determine $A \cap B$

   Let A and B be the event that a 4 letter string starts with $ad$ and ends with $dcb$

   The first 2 letters are locked in place: 1 possibility

   The last 3 letters are locked in place: 1 possibility

   $|A \cap B| = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$

4. Profit

   $A \cup B = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$

   $A \cup B = 16 + 4 - 1 $

   $A \cup B = 19$
