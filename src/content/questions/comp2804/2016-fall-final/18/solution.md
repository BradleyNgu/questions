I'm not sure what the right way to do this is 
Forget the other values, let's just focus on 3,4, and 8 
There are 3! ways to arrange 3,4, and 8: $ {(3,4,8), (3,8,4), (4,3,8), (4,8,3), (8,3,4), (8,4,3) } $
Out of those 6 ways, only 2 of them have 4 and 8 to the left of 3: $ { (4,8,3), (8,4,3) } $ 
$ Pr(A) = frac{2}{6} = frac{1}{3} $
