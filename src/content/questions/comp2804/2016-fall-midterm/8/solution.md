To determine the minimum value of $ m $ such that we can guarantee that a set $ S $ of $ m $ integers contains at least two elements whose difference is divisible by $ n $, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle.

Let $ k geq 1 $ be an integer. If $ k+1 $ or more objects are placed into $ k $ boxes, then there is at least one box containing two or more objects.

<ul>
    <li> textbf{Residue Classes Modulo $ n $:} <br/> 
    Consider the integers modulo $ n $. There are $ n $ possible residue classes: $ 0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 $.
    <li> textbf{Pigeonholes and Pigeons:} <br/> 
    Each integer in the set $ S $ will fall into one of these $ n $ residue classes. If $ m $ integers are placed into these $ n $ residue classes, then by the Pigeonhole Principle, if $ m > n $, at least two integers must fall into the same residue class.
    <li> textbf{Difference Divisible by $ n $:} <br/> 
    If two integers are in the same residue class, their difference is divisible by $ n $. Therefore, we need $ m $ to be large enough to ensure that at least two integers are guaranteed to fall into the same residue class.
</ul>

To guarantee that there are at least two elements whose difference is divisible by $ n $, we need at least one more than $ n $ integers. Thus, the minimum value of $ m $ is $ n + 1 $.

The minimum value of $ m $ such that we can guarantee that $ S $ contains at least two elements whose difference is divisible by $ n $ is $ n + 1 $.
$boxed{m = n + 1}$
