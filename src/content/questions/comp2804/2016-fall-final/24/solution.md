Let's find the probability of rolling a number that is divisible by 3 
The numbers that are divisible by 3 are 3 and 6 
$ Pr(X=1) = frac{2}{6} $ 
We can use the geometric distribution to find the expected value of X 
Basically, just do $ frac{1}{p} $ 
$ mathbb{E}(X) = frac{1}{frac{2}{6}} $ 
$ mathbb{E}(X) = 3 $
