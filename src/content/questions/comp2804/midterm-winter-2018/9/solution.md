We can use the dividers method to solve this problem. \\
We have 33 blocks (representing the sum of the 4 variables) and 3 dividers (representing the 3 partitions between the 4 variables). \\
We can place the 3 dividers into any of the 36 positions. \\
Everything before the first divider is $ x_1 $, everything between the first and second dividers is $ x_2 $, and so on. \\
Thus, there are $ \binom{36}{3} $ solutions to the equation.
