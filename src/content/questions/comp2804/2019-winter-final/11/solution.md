1. Find S

   Let S be the sample space of all possible outcomes of flipping a coin 6 times.

   $|S| = 2^6 = 64$

2. Find A

   Let A be the event that the coin comes up heads exactly 3 times.

   We choose 3 of the 6 flips to be heads: $\binom{6}{3} = 20$

   The remaining 3 flips must be tails: 1

3. Find $ \Pr(A) $

   $ \Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} $

   $ \Pr(A) = \frac{20}{64} = \frac{5}{16} $
