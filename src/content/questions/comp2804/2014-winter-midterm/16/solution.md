A = All 3 people have different birthdays
First person can have any birthday = 365
Second person can have any birthday except the first person's = 364
Third person can have any birthday except the first two people's = 363
$|A| = 365 \cdot 364 \cdot 363$
$ Pr(A) = \frac{365 \cdot 364 \cdot 363}{365^3}$
$ Pr(A) = \frac{364 \cdot 363}{365^2}$
$1 - Pr(A)$ is the probability that at least two of them have the same birthday
$= 1 - \frac{364 \cdot 363}{365^2}$
