We can solve this using stars and bars approach\\
There are 13 stars and 2 extra positions to place the bars/dividers between rows of stars
\begin{enumerate}
\item The number of stars to the left of the first bar is $x_1$
\item The number of stars between the first and second bars is $x_2$
\item The number of stars to the right of the second bar is $x_3$
\end{enumerate}
As a result, we pick 2 positions out of 13 and 2 positions to place the bars: $ \binom{15}{2} $
