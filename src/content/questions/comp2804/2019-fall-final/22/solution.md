Let's draw a summation table, dear

![alt text](image.png)

As can be seen, there are 6 ways to get a sum of 7: $ { (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) } $

The probability of getting a sum of 7 is $ \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6} $

By the geometric distribution, the expected value is $ \frac{1}{ \frac{1}{6}} = 6 $
