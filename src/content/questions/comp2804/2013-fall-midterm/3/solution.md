For 7 characters, there are $ 52^7 $ total possibilities.

For 6 characters, there are $ 52^6 $ total possibilities.

We can subtract the number of passwords that do not contain an uppercase letter from the total number of possibilities.

For 7 characters, there are $ 26^7 $ possibilities that do not contain an uppercase letter.

For 6 characters, there are $ 26^6 $ possibilities that do not contain an uppercase letter.

Thus, the number of passwords that contain an uppercase letter is $ 52^7 - 26^7 + 52^6 - 26^6 $
