Okay, so let's write down what we know

<ul>
    <li> A = blond <br/>
    $ |A| = 6 $
    <li> B = green eyes<br/>
    $ |B| = 7 $
    <li> It also says "11 are not blonde and do not have green eyes"<br/>
    They could be blonde and not have green eyes, green eyes and not blonde, or neither. <br/>
    Basically, 11 people are outside the intersection of A and B <br/>
    $ |\overline{A \cap B}| = 11 $
</uL>

We should find the union of A and B

$ | A \cup B | = 20 - 11 = 9 $

Now, let's use a formula to find the intersection of A and B

$ | A \cup B | = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $

$ 9 = 6 + 7 - |A \cap B| $

$ |A \cap B| = 4 $
