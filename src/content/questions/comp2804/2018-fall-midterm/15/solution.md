When looking for possible combinations of Trump and Kim standing together, we can treat them as a single entity in terms of position.
There are 2 possible ways to arrange Trump and Kim together.
Trump on left and Kim on right OR Kim on left and Trump on right: 2
When we do view them as a single entity together, we are left with 58 entities.
The third person has 57 possible positions to stand.
The fourth person has 56 possible positions to stand.
So on and so forth until the 59th person has 1 possible position to stand.
Thus, there are $ 2 cdot 58 cdot 57! $ ways to arrange the students.
There are a total of $ 59! $ ways to arrange the students if we didn't care about combination restrictions.
Thus, Pr$ (A) = frac{2 cdot 58 cdot 57!}{59!} = frac{2}{59} $
