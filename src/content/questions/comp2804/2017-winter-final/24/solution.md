Thank God I have a second monitor to watch YouTube videos on 
Alright, so let's break it down. It's asking for the probability that a $D_i$ is a cider and $D_{i+1}$ is not a cider 
First has probability of being cider $ frac{11}{12} $ 
Second has probability of not being cider $ frac{1}{12} $ 
This occurs 6 times. Not 7 because $D_n$ has no $D_{n+1}$ to compare it to 
$ mathbb{E}(X) = sum_{i=1}^{6} frac{11}{12} cdot frac{1}{12} $ 
$ mathbb{E}(X) = 6 cdot frac{11}{12} cdot frac{1}{12} $ 
$ mathbb{E}(X) = 6 cdot frac{11}{144} $ 
$ mathbb{E}(X) = frac{6}{144} $
