We can expand it. First, we pick 1 out of the 100 questions. There are 100 possibilities.

Then, the probability that we got it right is $(1/4)$

Then, the probability that the second question we do is wrong is $(3/4)$

Then, the probability that the third question we do is wrong is $(3/4)$

We can write this as:

$100 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot ... \cdot \frac{3}{4}$

$=100 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{3^{99}}{4^{99}}$

$=100 \cdot \frac{3^{99}}{4 \cdot 4^{99}}$

$=100 \cdot \frac{3^{99}}{4^{100}}$
