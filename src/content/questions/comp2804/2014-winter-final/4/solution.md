Since we want to keep Simon and John together, we can treat them as a single entity. 
This reduces the problem to arranging 7 entities (Simon and John as one entity and the other 6 people) on a line. 
There are 2 possible combinations with Simon on the left and John on the right, or Simon on the right and John on the left 
The first entity (Simon and John) has 7 possible positions to choose from 
The second entity has 6 possible positions to choose from 
The third entity has 5 possible positions to choose from 
ldots 
The seventh entity has 1 possible position to choose from 
The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people is $ 2 times 7 cdot 6! $
