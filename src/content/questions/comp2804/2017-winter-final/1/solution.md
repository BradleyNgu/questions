Well, let's break it down

<ul>
    <li> We can place the first odd number in any of the 5 odd positions: 5 <br/> 
    We can place the second odd number in any of the 4 remaining odd positions: 4 <br/> 
    ... <br/> 
    We can place the last odd number in the last remaining odd position: 1 <br/> 
    This creates $ 5! $ permutations
    <li> We can place the first even number in any of the 5 even positions: 5 <br/> 
    We can place the second even number in any of the 4 remaining even positions: 4 <br/> 
    ... <br/> 
    We can place the last even number in the last remaining even position: 1 <br/> 
    This creates $ 5! $ permutations
</ul>

Multiplying the two permutations, we get $ 5! \cdot 5! $
