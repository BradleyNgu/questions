Let's explain why some are wrong and one is right
\begin{enumerate}
\item The number of subsets having size 3 of a set consisting of $n$ positive numbers and $m$ negative numbers. \\
This one is right because it lets us pick 3 positive numbers OR 3 negative numbers OR 1 positive number and 2 negative numbers OR 1 negative number and 2 positive numbers
\item The number of subsets having size at most 3 of a set consisting of $n$ positive numbers and $m$ negative numbers. \\
this one is incorrect because the equation given misses sets of size 1 and 2
For instance, should've said $ \binom{n}{1} + \ldots $ but they didn't
\item The number of subsets having size 2 or 3 of a set consisting of $n$ positive numbers and $m$ negative numbers. \\
This one is incorrect because the equation given misses sets of size 1

\item The number of subsets having size 2 and 3 of a set consisting of $n$ positive numbers and $m$ negative numbers. \\
Uh, a set can't be of both size 2 and 3 at the same time. If I have 2 balls, I don't have 3 balls. If I have 3 balls, I don't have 2 balls
\end{enumerate}
