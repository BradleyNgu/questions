Forget making tables for this. I don't wanna

Now, let's see if there are any $\Pr(X=i)$ and $\Pr(Y=j)$ that don't have a product of 0, yet $\Pr(X_i \cap Y_j) = 0$

$ \Pr(X=1) $ is asking for rolls that have max values of 1: $ (1,1) $

$\Pr(X=1) = \frac{1}{36} $

$ \Pr(Y=12) $ is asking for rolls with a sum of 12: $ (6,6) $

$ \Pr(Y=12) = \frac{1}{36} $

$ \Pr(X=1 \cap Y=12) $ is asking for rolls that have max values of 1 yet produce a sum of 12. This is impossible. 1 and 1 don't make 12, so the probability is 0

$ \Pr(X=1 \cap Y=12) = 0$

As you can see, it isn't independence day
