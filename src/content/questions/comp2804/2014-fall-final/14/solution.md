Let's go through each option and explain

<ul>
<li> $1 - (1/2)^{7}$ 
This is just the complement rule, which usually works but they're subtracting the probability that we get 6 tails followed by a head 
It might've worked if they were subtracting the probability that we get 7 tails followed by a head from the whole set of possibilities
<li> $sum_{k=0}^{7} (1/2)^{k}$ 
This one is wrong because it starts at $ { left( frac{1}{2} right)}^0 $ but it doesn't take into account the fact that we have to flip a head to stop, which has a probability of $ frac{1}{2} $
	<li> $sum_{k=0}^{7} (1/2)^{k+1}$ 
This one is beautiful 
It says, probability of flipping a heads right away, probability of flipping a tails folloewd by a heads, probability of flipping 2 tails followed by a heads, and so on until 7 tails followed by a heads
</ul>
