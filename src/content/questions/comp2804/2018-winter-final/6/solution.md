We can rephrase this into something more familiar. Let $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7$ be the number of bananas Nick eats on each day.
$ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 = 25 $
This is one of the divider questions
Assume we have 25 bananas and 6 dividers. We place the dividers between any set of bananas to indicate how many are eaten between dividers

<ul>
<li> $x_1$ is represented as the number of bananas eaten to the left of the first divider
<li> $x_2$ is represented as the number of bananas eaten between the first and second divider
<li> $x_3$ is represented as the number of bananas eaten between the second and third divider
<li> $x_4$ is represented as the number of bananas eaten between the third and fourth divider
<li> $x_5$ is represented as the number of bananas eaten between the fourth and fifth divider
<li> $x_6$ is represented as the number of bananas eaten between the fifth and sixth divider
<li> $x_7$ is represented as the number of bananas eaten to the right of the sixth divider
</ul>
Since we place dividers down, we need to add 6 dividers to the 25 bananas 
We choose 6 positions out of the 31 for the dividers: $ binom{31}{6} $
