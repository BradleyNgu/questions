We can check the first few cases to see which answer matches the pattern:

<ul>
  <li> $m=1, n=1: 2$
  <li> $m=2, n=2: 6$
</ul>

If we now plug in these values into the answers we are given for $m=1, n=1$:

<ul>
  <li> $binom{m+n}{n-1} = binom{1+1}{1-1} = binom{2}{0} = 1$
  <li> $binom{m+n}{n} = binom{1+1}{1} = binom{2}{1} = 2$
  <li> $2^{m+n} = 2^{1+1} = 2^{2} = 4$
  <li> $2^{m} + 2^{n} = 2^{1} + 2^{1} = 2 + 2 = 4$
</ul>

As you can see, the only answer that works is b).
