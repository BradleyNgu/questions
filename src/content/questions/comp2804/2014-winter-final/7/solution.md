Let's break it down

<ul>
	<li> Let A = 3 blue balls <br/>
	We choose 3 of the 4 blue balls $ \binom{4}{3} $ <br/>
	The first red ball has 3 possible positions, second has 2 possible remaining positions, and the third has 1 remaining possible position: $ 3! $ <br/>
	$ |A| = \binom{4}{3} \times 3! $ <br/>
	$ |A| = 4 \times 3! $ <br/>
	$ |A| = 24 $
	<li> Let B = 3 red balls <br/>
	We choose 3 of the 5 red balls: $ \binom{5}{3} $ <br/>
	The first blue ball has 3 possible positions, second has 2 possible remaining positions, and the third has 1 remaining possible position: $ 3! $ <br/>
	$ |B| = \binom{5}{3} \times 3! $ <br/>
	$ |B| = 10 \times 3! $ <br/>
	$ |B| = 60 $
</ul>

The total number of arrangements is the sum of the arrangements in sets $ A \cup B $:

$ |A| + |B| $

$ = 24 + 60 $

$ = 84 $
