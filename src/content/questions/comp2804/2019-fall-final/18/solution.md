<ul>
<li> Let's determine $S$ 
$ |S| = 10 $
	<li> Let's determine $A$ 
There are 5 even numbers: 5 
$ |A| = 5 $
	      $ Pr(A) = frac{5}{10} = frac{1}{2} $
	<li> Let's determine $B$ 
There are 6 numbers between 1 and 6: 6 
$ |B| = 6 $ 
$ Pr(B) = frac{6}{10} = frac{3}{5} $
	<li> Let's determine $A cap B$ 
There are 3 numbers that are both even and between 1 and 6, which are 2, 4, and 6: 2 
$ |A cap B| = 3 $ 
$ Pr(A cap B) = frac{3}{10} $
</ul>
Caedrel is the best rat 
Let's check for independence 
$ Pr(A cap B) = Pr(A) cdot Pr(B) $ 
$ frac{3}{10} = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{3}{5} $ 
$ frac{3}{10} = frac{3}{10} $ 
Therefore, it is independent
