To guarantee that at least two people share the same birthday, the first 365 people each have a different birthday. 
The last person must have a birthday that is the same as one of the previous 365 people. 
We can apply this to 3 people. 
Thus, the minimum number of people needed is double 365 + 1. 
$2 cdot 365 + 1 = 731$
