The first book can be placed on any of the 7 shelves. \\
The second book can be placed in 8 spots because it can be put to the left of the first book or the right of the first book \\
The third book can be placed in 9 spots because it can be put to the left of the first book, between the first and second book, or to the right of the second book \\
The fourth book can be placed in 10 spots because it can be put to the left of the first book, between the first and second book, between the second and third book, or to the right of the third book \\
The fifth book can be placed in 11 spots because it can be put to the left of the first book, between the first and second book, between the second and third book, between the third and fourth book, or to the right of the fourth book \\
$ 7 \cdot 8 \cdot 9 \cdot 10 \cdot 11 $ \\
$ = \frac{11!}{6!} $
