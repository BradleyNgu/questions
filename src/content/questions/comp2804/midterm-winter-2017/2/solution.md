There are $ g $ ways to choose the leftmost kid: $ g $ \\
We can take any of the $ b+g-1 $ kids to be the second kid: $ b+g-1 $ \\
We can take any of the $ b+g-2 $ kids to be the third kid: $ b+g-2 $ \\
This decrements until we reach the last kid: $ 1 $ \\
Thus, there are $ g \cdot (b+g-1)! $ ways to arrange the kids.
