We can calculate the probability that none of the 4 people have the same birthday. \\
B = No one has the same birthday. \\
The first person has 365 choices. \\
The second person has 364 choices. \\
The third person has 363 choices. \\
The fourth person has 362 choices. \\
$ |B| = 365 \cdot 364 \cdot 363 \cdot 362 $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = 1 - \frac{|B|}{365^4} $
$ \Pr(A) = 1 - \frac{365 \cdot 364 \cdot 363 \cdot 362}{365^4} $
$ \Pr(A) = 1 - \frac{364 \cdot 363 \cdot 362}{365^3} $
