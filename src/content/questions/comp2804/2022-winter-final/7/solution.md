Let's treat CAB as a single letter

That means we have

<ul>
    <li> 1 CAB
    <li> 2 A's
    <li> 1 R
    <li> 1 I
</ul>

Since we have 5 entities in total, it means we have 5 positions

We choose 1 position out of the 5 positions to place CAB: $ \binom{5}{1} = 5 $

We choose 2 positions out of the remaining 4 positions to place A's: $ \binom{4}{2} = 6 $

We choose 1 position out of the remaining 2 positions to place R: $ \binom{2}{1} = 2 $

We choose 1 position out of the remaining 1 position to place I: $ \binom{1}{1} = 1 $

Thus, the final answer is $ 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 60 $
