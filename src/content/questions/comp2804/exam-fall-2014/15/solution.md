\begin{enumerate}
\item Let A = Event that both balls are red \\
A occurs when we choose 2 of the 4 red balls \\
$ |A| = \binom{4}{2} $
	\item Let B = Event that both balls have the same color \\
	      B occurs when we choose 2 of the 5 blue balls or 2 of the 4 red balls \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{5}{2} + \binom{4}{2} $
	\item Let $A \cap B$ = Event that both balls are red and both balls have the same color \\
$ |A \cap B| = \binom{4}{2} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\binom{4}{2}}{\binom{5}{2} + \binom{4}{2}} $
