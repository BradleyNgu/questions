<li> Let A = Event that both balls are blue 
A occurs when we choose 2 of the 5 blue balls 
$ |A| = \binom{5}{2} $
	<li> Let B = Event that both balls are red 
	      B occurs when we choose 2 of the 4 red balls 
	      $ |B| = \binom{4}{2} $
	<li> Let C = Event that both balls are green 
	      C occurs when we choose 2 of the 6 green balls 
	      $ |C| = \binom{6}{2} $
	<li> Let S = All possible outcomes 
	      S occurs when we choose 2 of the 15 balls 
	      $ |S| = \binom{15}{2} $

$ |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| $ 
$ |A \cup B \cup C| = \binom{5}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{6}{2} $ 
$ Pr(A \cup B \cup C) = \frac{\binom{5}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{6}{2}}{\binom{15}{2}} $
