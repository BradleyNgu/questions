There are 13 letters in the word "POOPERSCOOPER".

We can break down how many letters of each there are:

<ul>
    <li> 3 P's
    <li> 4 O's
    <li> 2 E's
    <li> 2 R's
    <li> 1 C
    <li> 1 S
</ul>

<ul>
    <li> We choose 1 C from the 13 spots = $\binom{13}{1}$
    <li> We choose 4 O's from the remaining 12 spots = $\binom{12}{4}$
    <li> We choose 2 E's from the remaining 8 spots = $\binom{8}{2}$
    <li> We choose 1 S from the remaining 6 spots = $\binom{6}{1}$
    <li> We choose 2 R's from the remaining 5 spots = $\binom{5}{2}$
    <li> We choose 3 P's from the remaining 3 spots = $\binom{3}{3}$
</ul>

Thus, the total number of strings is

$\binom{13}{1} \cdot \binom{12}{4} \cdot \binom{8}{2} \cdot \binom{6}{1} \cdot \binom{5}{2} \cdot \binom{3}{3}$
