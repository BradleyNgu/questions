<ul>
    <li> Let A = Event that $x$ is even <br/>
    A occurs when we choose an even number from the set ${2, 4, 6, 8, 10}$ <br/>
    $ |A| = 5 $
    <li> Let B = Event that $x$ is divisible by 3 <br/>
    B occurs when we choose a number from the set ${3, 6, 9}$ <br/>
    $ |B| = 3 $
    <li> Let $A \cap B$ = Event that $x$ is even and divisible by 3 <br/>
    $ |A \cap B| = 1 $
</ul>

$ Pr(A|B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|} $

$ Pr(A|B) = \frac{1}{3} $
