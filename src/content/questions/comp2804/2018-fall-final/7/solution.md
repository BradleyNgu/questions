First, we take a E and a U and treat them as a single entity, so the conditions are met
Since the entity can be either EU or UE, there are double the possibilities: 2
We now act as if we only have 6 entitieS.
There are 6 possible positions for the EU/UE to go: 6
For the 3 $S$'s, we choose 3 positions out of the 5: $ binom{5}{3} $
For the 2 $C$'s, we choose 2 positions out of the 2: $ binom{2}{2} = 1 $
$ 2 cdot 6 cdot binom{5}{3} $
$ = 2 cdot 6 cdot frac{5!}{3!2!} $
$ = 2 cdot 6 cdot frac{5 cdot 4}{2} $
$ = 2 cdot 6 cdot 10 $
$ = 2 cdot 60 $
$ = 120 $
