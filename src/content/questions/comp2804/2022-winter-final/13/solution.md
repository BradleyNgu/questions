Since each roll of a dice does not affect the results of the next roll, this means that each dice roll is an independent event.

The only results with a remainder of 0 when divided by 4 are 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28.

You can brute force the solution, by calculating all the probabilities of those numbers, with the result being $\frac{1}{4}$.
