Let A = Event that Annie, Boris, and Charlie have the same birthday \\
Annie has a birthday on any of the 365 days: 365 \\
Boris would only then have a birthday on the same day as Annie: 1 \\
Charlie would only then have a birthday on the same day as Annie and Boris: 1 \\
$ |A| = 365 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 $ \\
Let S = All possible outcomes \\
$ |S| = 365^3 $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{365}{365^3} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{1}{365^2} $
