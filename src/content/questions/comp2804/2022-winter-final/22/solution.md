Technically, to solve this question, we would have to prove that for every possible real number, that $Pr(X = x \cap Y = y) = Pr(X = x) \cdot Pr(Y = y)$. \\ \\

Here is more of a conceptual reason why the two random variables are independent. \\

The event Y, does not depend on the results of event X. Since the probability of
