It's a little confusing when you know why the correct answer is correct, but you don't know why the incorrect answers are incorrect.
Let's go through all of them

<ul>
<li> The number of ways to choose an ordered pair $(x,y)$ from a group consisting of $m$ men and $n$ women, where $x$ must be a man and $y$ must be a woman. 
So this one is wrong because the phrase they use only takes into account when we have a man and a women: $m cdot n$ 
But the equation given shows that we could have 2 men or 2 women as a unordered pair.
<li> The number of ways to choose an ordered pair $(x,y)$ from a group consisting of $m$ men and $n$ women where $x$ and $y$ cannot both be men. 
For this one, it says $x$ and $y$ cannot both be men but $ binom{m}{2} $ gives us unordered pairs of men in the equation 
Since the phrase doesn't match the equation, this one is wrong.
<li> The number of ways to choose an unordered pair of people from a group consisting of $m$ men and $n$ women, where at least one man must be chosen. 
For this one, it says enquote{at least one man must be chosen} but the equation has $ binom{m}{2} $ which gives us unordered of women as well 
Since the phrase doesn't match the equation, this one is wrong.
<li> The number of ways to choose an unordered pair of people from a group consisting of $m$
men and $n$ women. 
For this one, the phrase matches the equation. We take into account 2 men, 2 women, and 1 man-1 woman
</ul>
