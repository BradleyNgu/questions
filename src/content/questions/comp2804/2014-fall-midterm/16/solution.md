We can write it out $ldots$

The first ball has a $10/10$ possibility of getting into an empty box

The second ball has $9/10$ possibility of getting into an empty box

Assuming the previous balls are in different boxes, the third ball has 8/10 possibility of getting into an empty box

We can write this down as $ldots$

$=frac{10}{10} cdot frac{9}{10} cdot frac{8}{10} cdot frac{7}{10} cdot frac{6}{10} cdot frac{5}{10} cdot frac{4}{10} cdot frac{3}{10} cdot frac{2}{10} cdot frac{1}{10}$

$=frac{10!}{{10}^{10}}$
