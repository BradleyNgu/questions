Let's use dividers to separate the bananas eaten per day. \\
We have 75 bananas and 4 dividers.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x_1$ represents the number of bananas to the left of the first divider
\item $x_2$ represents the number of bananas between the first and second dividers
\item $x_3$ represents the number of bananas between the second and third dividers
\item $x_4$ represents the number of bananas between the third and fourth dividers
\item $x_5$ represents the number of bananas to the right of the fourth divider
\end{enumerate}
Since we have added positions for dividers to the 75 bananas, we have 79 positions in total. \\
We need to choose 4 positions for the dividers: $ \binom{79}{4} $
