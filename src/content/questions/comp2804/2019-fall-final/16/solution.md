<li> Let's determine $B$ 
There are 3 numbers divisible by 3, which are $ { 3, 6, 9 } $: 3 
	      $ |B| = 3 $
	<li> Let's determine $A \cap B$ 
There is only 1 number that is both even and divisible by 3, which is 6: 1 
$ |A \cap B| = 1 $
</ul>
I enjoy Jujutsu Kaisen and Donal/Joe/Obama AI voice skits 
$ Pr(A|B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|} = \frac{1}{3} $
