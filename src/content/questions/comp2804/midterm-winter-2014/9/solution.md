There are 13 letters in the word enquote{POOPERSCOOPER}. 
We can break down how many letters of each there are: 
3 P's 
4 O's 
2 E's 
2 R's 
1 C 
1 S 
We choose 1 C from the 13 spots = $binom{13}{1}$ 
We choose 4 O's from the remaining 12 spots = $binom{12}{4}$ 
We choose 2 E's from the remaining 8 spots = $binom{8}{2}$ 
We choose 1 S from the remaining 6 spots = $binom{6}{1}$ 
We choose 2 R's from the remaining 5 spots = $binom{5}{2}$ 
We choose 3 P's from the remaining 3 spots = $binom{3}{3}$ 
Thus, the total number of strings is 
$binom{13}{1} cdot binom{12}{4} cdot binom{8}{2} cdot binom{6}{1} cdot binom{5}{2} cdot binom{3}{3}$
