$x$ can be any of the 100 elements in $A$: 100

For $y$ to be equal to $x$, there is only 1 favorable outcome out of 100: 1

Similarly, for $z$ to be equal to $x$, there is only 1 favorable outcome out of 100: 1

The probability that $x = y = z$ is the product of the probabilities of each event:

$P(x = y = z) = \frac{100}{100} \times \frac{1}{100} = \frac{1}{100}$

$P(x = y = z) = \frac{1}{100 \cdot 100}$
