1.  Find A

    Let A be the event that x is even

    We choose 1 of the 5 even numbers in A: $\binom{5}{1}$

    We choose 1 of the 14 numbers in B: $\binom{14}{1}$

    $|A| = \binom{5}{1} \cdot \binom{14}{1} = 70$

2.  Find B

    Let B be the event that y is even

    We choose 1 of the 10 numbers in A: $\binom{10}{1}$

    We choose 1 of the 7 even numbers in B: $\binom{7}{1}$

    $|B| = \binom{10}{1} \cdot \binom{7}{1} = 70$

3.  Find $A \cap B$

    Let $A \cap B$ be the event that x is even and y is even

    We choose 1 of the 5 even numbers in A: $\binom{5}{1}$

    We choose 1 of the 7 even numbers in B: $\binom{7}{1}$

    $|A \cap B| = \binom{5}{1} \cdot \binom{7}{1} = 35$

4.  Profit

    $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$

    $= 70 + 70 - 35$

    $= 105$
