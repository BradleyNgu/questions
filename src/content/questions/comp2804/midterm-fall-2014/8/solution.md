Suppose we have 27 blocks.

$x_1$ takes up 0 to 27 blocks. Same goes with $x_2, x_3$ and $x_4$

If we put dividers between each x, then we have 3 dividers. Since the dividers also take up space, then we can assume we have 27 spots + 3 spots for dividers.

We can put the dividers into any of these 30 spots and are looking for the number of combinations. We are choosing 3 spots from 30.

$\binom{30}{3}$
