Well, let's write out and see what happens. We start off with an even number of $c$'s, which is 0 
If we place an $a$, then we still have an even number of $c$'s, so we call the even number of $c$'s $E_{n-1}$ 
If we place a $b$, then we still have an even number of $c$'s, so we call the even number of $c$'s $E_{n-1}$ 
If we place a $c$, then we now have an odd number of $c$'s, so we call the odd number of $c$'s $O_{n-1}$ 
This means that $E_n = E_{n-1} + E_{n-1} + O_{n-1} = 2E_{n-1} + O_{n-1}$
