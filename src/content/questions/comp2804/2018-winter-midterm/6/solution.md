We can use pigeonhole principle to solve this problem.
We need to have 1 more than the maximum number of possible last names.
That way, we can guarantee that if all people have different last names, the last person will have a duplicate.
There are $ 26 $ possible uppercase letters for the first letter of the last name.
There are $ 25 $ possible lowercase letters for the second letter of the last name.
There are $ 24 $ possible lowercase letters for the third letter of the last name.
Thus, the minimum size of the population of ShortLastName is $ 26 \cdot 25 \cdot 24 + 1 $.
