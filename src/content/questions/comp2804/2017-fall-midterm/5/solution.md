$ |S| = 2^n $

B = subsets that contain no even numbers.

Since it's incremental, we know half the values are odd and half are even.

That means there are a total of $ 2^{ \frac{n}{2}} $ subsets that contain no even numbers.

$ |B| = 2^{ \frac{n}{2}} $

A = subsets that contain at least one even number.

$ |A| = 2^n - |B| $

$ |A| = 2^n - 2^{ \frac{n}{2}} $
