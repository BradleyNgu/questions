So um, this algorithm pretty much counts the number of attempts we make until we get $HHH$ or $TTT$ \\
We have a $ \frac{1}{8} $ chance of flipping an $HHH$ \\
We have a $ \frac{1}{8} $ chance of flipping an $TTT$ \\
This gives us a $ \frac{1}{4} $ chance of flipping either $HHH$ or $TTT$ \\
By the geometric distribution, the expected value of the number of attempts until we get a success is $ \frac{1}{p} $ \\
Therefore, the expected value of $X$ is $ \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}} = 4 $
