We don't need to calculate all possibilities. Since this is independence, we're looking for $ Pr(X=x cap Y=y) = Pr(X=x) cdot Pr(Y=y) $
<ul>
	<li> Let's try $X=5$ 
The only rolls that satisfy this are $ (1,6), (6,1) $ 
$ Pr(X=5) = frac{2}{36} = frac{1}{18} $
	<li> Let's try $Y=1$ 
The only rolls that satisfy this are $ (1,1) $ 
$ Pr(Y=1) = frac{1}{36} $
	<li> $ Pr(X=5 cap Y=1) $ 
	      If the only rolls that satisfy condition 1 are $ (1,6), (6,1) $ and the only rolls that satisfy condition 2 are $ (1,1) $, then there are no rolls that satisfy both conditions 
	      $ Pr(X=5 cap Y=1) = 0 $
</ul>
Now, check time 
$ Pr(X=5 cap Y=1) = Pr(X=5) cdot Pr(Y=1) $ 
$ 0 = frac{1}{18} cdot frac{1}{36} $ 
$ 0 = frac{1}{648} $ 
Since the equation is false, there are dependent
