1 is odd, 2 is even, 3 is odd, 4 is even, etc etc
This pattern of odd followed by even shows us that half the elements are even and half are odd.
We need to choose 4 even numbers from $ \frac{n}{2} $ even numbers.
There are $ \binom{ \frac{n}{2}}{4} $ ways to do this.
We need to choose 3 odd numbers from $ \frac{n}{2} $ odd numbers.
There are $ \binom{ \frac{n}{2}}{3} $ ways to do this.
Thus, there are $ \binom{ \frac{n}{2}}{4} \cdot \binom{ \frac{n}{2}}{3} $ ways to choose 4 even numbers and 3 odd numbers.
