For 13 characters, there are $10^{13}$ total possibilities. 
For 12 characters, there are $10^{12}$ total possibilities. 
We can subtract the number of passwords that do not contain the digit 7 from the total number of possibilities. 
For 13 characters, there are $9^{13}$ possibilities that do not contain the digit 7. 
For 12 characters, there are $9^{12}$ possibilities that do not contain the digit 7. 
Thus, the number of passwords that contain the digit 7 at least once is $10^{13} - 9^{13} + 10^{12} - 9^{12}$
