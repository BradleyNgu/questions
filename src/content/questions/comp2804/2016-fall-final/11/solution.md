We can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem.
We have 4 dividers and 28 stars.

<ul>
<li> $x_1$ is the number of stars to the left of the first divider
<li> $x_2$ is the number of stars between the first and second dividers
<li> $x_3$ is the number of stars between the second and third dividers
<li> $x_4$ is the number of stars between the third and fourth dividers
<li> $x_5$ is the number of stars to the right of the fourth divider
</ul>
The number of solutions to the equation is $ binom{28+4}{4} $
