We can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. 
We have 3 dividers and 99 stars.
<ul>
<li> $x_1$ is the number of stars to the left of the first divider
<li> $x_2$ is the number of stars between the first and second dividers
<li> $x_3$ is the number of stars between the second and third dividers
<li> $x_4$ is the number of stars to the right of the third divider
</ul>
The number of solutions to the equation is $ binom{99+3}{3} $
