<ul>
<li> Let S be the set of all students. 
$ |S| = 100 $
	<li> Let C be the event that someone drinks cider 
	      $ |C| = 25 $
	<li> Let B be the event that someone drinks beer 
	      $ |B| = 50 $
	<li> Let $ overline{C} cap overline{B} $ be the event that someone does not drink cider and does not drink beer 
	      $ | overline{C} cap overline{B} | = 33 $
</ul>
Find the union of C and B 
$ |C cup B| = |S| - | overline{C} cap overline{B} | $ 
$ |C cup B| = 100 - 33 $ 
$ |C cup B| = 67 $ 
Now, we find the intersection of C and B 
$ |C cup B| = |C| + |B| - |C cap B| $ 
$ 67 = 25 + 50 - |C cap B| $ 
$ |C cap B| = 8 $
