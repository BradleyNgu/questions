We know that Trumps can't stand beside Kims, so the Supermans have to be in the middle. \\
It could look like TTSSKK or KKSSTT \\
So this doubles the number of possibilities. \\
We need to arrange the Supermans in their own section. \\
There are $ s! $ ways to do this. \\
We need to arrange the Trumps in their own section. \\
There are $ t! $ ways to do this. \\
We need to arrange the Kims in their own section. \\
There are $ k! $ ways to do this. \\
Thus, there are $ 2 \cdot s! \cdot t! \cdot k! $ ways to arrange the students.
