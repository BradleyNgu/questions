We can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. \\
We have 3 dividers and 99 stars.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x_1$ is the number of stars to the left of the first divider
\item $x_2$ is the number of stars between the first and second dividers
\item $x_3$ is the number of stars between the second and third dividers
\item $x_4$ is the number of stars to the right of the third divider
\end{enumerate}
The number of solutions to the equation is $ \binom{99+3}{3} $
