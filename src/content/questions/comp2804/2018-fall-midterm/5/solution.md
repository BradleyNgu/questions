We can use the dividers method to solve this problem. 
We have 17 blocks (representing the sum of the 5 variables) and 4 dividers (representing the 4 partitions between the 5 variables). 
We can place the 4 dividers into any of the 21 positions.
Everything before the first divider is $ x_1 $, everything between the first and second dividers is $ x_2 $, and so on. 
Thus, there are $ binom{21}{4} $ solutions to the equation.
