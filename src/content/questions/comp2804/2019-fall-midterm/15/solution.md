Let's calculate all possible combinations of the first 2 flips

<ul>
    <li> $HH$
    <li> $HT$
    <li> $TH$
    <li> $TT$
</ul>

Out of the 4 combinations, only 2 of them have the first flip being different from the second flip.

Therefore, the probability of the first flip being different from the second flip is $\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}$
