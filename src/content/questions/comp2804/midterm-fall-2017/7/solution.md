$ \binom{n}{k} $ is taking k a's while the rest are b's or c's
$ 2^{n-k} $ is taking the rest of the bits and making them b's or c's
Because we increment the value of k, we're saying the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 2 a's and the rest are b's or c's
\item 3 a's and the rest are b's or c's
\item 4 a's and the rest are b's or c's
\item etc etc
\end{enumerate}
With this, we capture all the possibilities of having k a's and the rest being b's or c's.
