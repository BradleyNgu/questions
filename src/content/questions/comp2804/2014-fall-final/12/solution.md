	<li> Let A = Event that both balls are blue <br/>
	A occurs when we choose 2 of the 5 blue balls <br/>
	$ |A| = \binom{5}{2} $

	B occurs when we choose 2 of the 4 red balls <br/>

	C occurs when we choose 2 of the 6 green balls <br/>
	$ |C| = \binom{6}{2} $
	<li> Let S = All possible outcomes <br/>
	S occurs when we choose 2 of the 15 balls <br/>
	$ |S| = \binom{15}{2} $

$ |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| $

$ |A \cup B \cup C| = \binom{5}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{6}{2} $

$ Pr(A \cup B \cup C) = \frac{\binom{5}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{6}{2}}{\binom{15}{2}} $
