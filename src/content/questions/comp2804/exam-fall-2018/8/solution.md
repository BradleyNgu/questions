Let's write out the possibilities and sum them \\
$2, S_{n-2} $ \\
$4, S_{n-4} $ \\
The reason this works is because it's as if we have n balls. We have baskets that can store 2 balls and baskets that can store 4 balls. \\
We can choose to put 2 balls in the 2-ball basket or in the 4-ball basket \\
Every time we use one of the baskets, we subtract by that number of balls \\
$ S*n = S*{n-2} + S\_{n-4} $
