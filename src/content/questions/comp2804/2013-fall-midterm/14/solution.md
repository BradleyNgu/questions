For answer c), if we sub in $n = 7$, then we are trying to find the number osf subsets of $\{1, 2, ... 7 \}$ having size 7. There is only 1 way to do this (choosing all the numbers in the set $\{1, 2, ... 7 \}$, which matches the summation $\sum_{k=7}^{n} \binom{k-1}{6} = \sum_{k=7}^{7} \binom{k-1}{6} = 1$.
For the options a) and b), there are more than one subset having size 5 and size 6, which means it doesn't match the summation in the question description.
