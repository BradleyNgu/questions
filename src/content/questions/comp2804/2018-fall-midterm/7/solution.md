If $ x_3 = 7 $, then we need to choose 2 elements from the set $ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} $ for $ x_1 $ and $ x_2 $ 
There are $ binom{6}{2} $ ways to choose 2 elements from the set $ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} $ 
We need to choose 2 elements from the set $ {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17} $ for $ x_4 $ and $ x_5 $ 
There are $ binom{10}{2} $ ways to choose 2 elements from the set $ {8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17} $ 
Thus, there are $ binom{6}{2} cdot binom{10}{2} $ such subsets.
