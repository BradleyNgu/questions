$Pr(A)$ = probability of first flip being heads = $1/2$

$Pr(B)$ = probability of fifth flip being heads = $1/2$

$Pr(A \cap B)$ = probability of both the first and fifth flip being heads = $(1/2) \cdot (1/2) = 1/4$

$|A \cup B| = |A|+|B|-|A \cap B|$

$|A \cup B| = \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}$

$|A \cup B| = \frac{3}{4}$
