1. Calculate the whole set

   Let S be the set of all possible outcomes.

   There are $ 2^4 = 16 $ possible outcomes.

   $|S|=16$

2. Calculat size of event

   Let A be the event that we land exactly 2 heads

   We can choose 2 spots for the heads out of the 4 spots: $ \binom{4}{2} $

   $|A| = \binom{4}{2}$

3. Profit

   $\Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|}$

   $\Pr(A) = \frac{\binom{4}{2}}{16}$
