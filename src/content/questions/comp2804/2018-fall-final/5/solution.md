Let's break down which ones are right and which ones are wrong

<ul>
    <li> The number of subsets of $S$ that are non-empty. <br/> 
    This phrase takes into account subsets of size 1 but the equation starts at 2. This is wrong.
    <li> The number of subsets of $S$ that contain at least two elements. <br/> 
    So this one looks right. We start off at subsets of size at least 2 and go all the way up to subsets of size $n$. This is correct.
    <li> The number of bitstrings of length $n$ that contain at least one 0. <br/> 
    So this one is wrong because it doesn't contain bitstrings that contain one 0
    <li> The number of bitstrings of length $n$ that contain at least three 0's. <br/> 
    This one is wrong because it doesn't contain bitstrings that contain at two 0's
</ul>
