\subsection{Question 1}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $A$ be a set of size 25 and let $B$ be a set of size 17. How many functions $f:A \rightarrow B$ are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Functions (3.1.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
The first input has 17 choices, the second input has 17 choices, and so on. \\
Thus, there are $ 17^{25} $ functions

\subsection{Question 2}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $A$ be a set of size 6 and let $B$ be a set of size 25. How many one-to-one functions $f: A \rightarrow B$ are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Product Rule (3.1), Counting Functions (3.1.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
The first input has 25 choices \\
The second input has 24 choices \\
The third input has 23 choices \\
The fourth input has 22 choices \\
The fifth input has 21 choices \\
The sixth input has 20 choices \\
Thus, there are $ 25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23 \cdot 22 \cdot 21 \cdot 20 $ possible one-to-one functions. \\
Writing this as a fraction, we get
$ \frac{25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23 \cdot 22 \cdot 21 \cdot 20}{1} $ \\
$ \frac{25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23 \cdot 22 \cdot 21 \cdot 20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18 \cdot 17 \cdot 16 \cdot 15 \cdot 14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{19 \cdot 18 \cdot 17 \cdot 16 \cdot 15 \cdot 14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} $ \\
$ \frac{25!}{19!} $

\subsection{Question 3}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $A$ be a set of size 5 and let $B$ be a set of size 14. How many functions $f: A \rightarrow B$ are there that are not one-to-one? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Product Rule (3.1), Counting Functions (3.1.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let S = Set of all functions \\
Each of 5 inputs has 14 possible outputs \\
Thus, there are $|S| = 14^5 $ \\
Let A = Set of all one-to-one functions \\
The first input has 14 choices, the second input has 13 choices, and so on until the fifth input has 10 choices. \\
Thus, there are $ |A| = 14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 = \frac{14!}{9!}$ one-to-one functions. \\
To determine the number of functions that are not one-to-one, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \\
$ |S - A| = |S| - |A| $ \\
$ |S - A| = 14^5 - \frac{14!}{9!} $

\subsection{Question 4}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You are given 6 distinct books and 5 identical blocks of wood. How many ways are there to arrange these books and blocks in a straight line? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Solutions of Linear Equations (3.9.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We can treat the 5 blocks of wood as dividers. \\
We have 6 books and 5 dividers, so there are $ 11! $ ways to arrange them. \\
However, the 5 blocks of wood are identical, so we must divide by $ 5! $ to account for this. \\
Thus, there are $ \frac{11!}{5!} $ ways to arrange the books and blocks.

\subsection{Question 5}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $S$ be a set of size 37, and let $x$ and $y$ be two distinct elements of $S$.
How many subsets of $S$ are there that contain $x$ but do not contain $y$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Bijection Rule (3.2.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $A$ be the set of all subsets of $S$ that contain $x$. \\
Let $B$ be the set of all subsets of $S$ that contain $x$ and $y$. \\
Thus, the number of subsets of $S$ that contain $x$ but do not contain $y$ is $ |A - B| $. \\
$ |A| = 2^{37-1} $ \\
$ |B| = 2^{37-2} $ \\
$ |A - B| = |A| - |B| $ \\
$ |A - B| = 2^{37-1} - 2^{37-2} $ \\
$ |A - B| = 2^{36} - 2^{35} $ \\
$ |A - B| = 2 \cdot 2^{35} - 2^{35} $ \\
$ |A - B| = (2-1) \cdot  2^{35} $ \\
$ |A - B| = 1 \cdot  2^{35} $ \\
$ |A - B| = 2^{35} $

\subsection{Question 6}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} How many bitstrings of length 6 start with 10 or end with 01? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let A = Set of bitstrings of length 6 that start with 10 \\
The first 2 bits are fixed; however, each other the other remaining 4 bits can be either 0 or 1. \\
Because the remaining bits have 2 choices Each
$ |A| = 2^4 $ \\
Let B = Set of bitstrings of length 6 that end with 01 \\
The last 2 bits are fixed; however, each other the other remaining 4 bits can be either 0 or 1. \\
Because the remaining bits have 2 choices Each
$ |B| = 2^4 $ \\
Let A $ \cap $ B = Set of bitstrings of length 6 that start with 10 and end with 01 \\
The first 2 bits are fixed, and the last 2 bits are fixed; however, each other the other remaining 2 bits can be either 0 or 1. \\
Because the remaining bits have 2 choices Each
$ |A \cap B| = 2^2 $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = 2^4 + 2^4 - 2^2 $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = 16 + 16 - 4 $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = 28 $

\subsection{Question 7}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} The number of different strings that can be made by reordering the 10 letters of the word HELLOHELLO is
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Reordering the Letters of a Word (3.9.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's first count the number of times each letter appears in the word HELLOHELLO
\begin{enumerate}
	\item H 2
	\item E 2
	\item L 4
	\item O 2
\end{enumerate}
There are 10 positions to put the 4 O's: $ \binom{10}{4} $ \\
There are 6 positions to put the 2 E's: $ \binom{6}{2} $ \\
There are 4 positions to put the 2 H's: $ \binom{4}{2} $ \\
There are 2 positions to put the 2 L's: $ \binom{2}{2} $ \\
Thus, the number of different strings that can be made by reordering the 10 letters of the word HELLOHELLO is $ \binom{10}{4} \cdot \binom{6}{2} \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{2} $ \\
Since answer c has the final binomial as $ \binom{3}{2} $, it cannot be the correct answer.

\subsection{Question 8}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A jar contains 17 red balls and 22 blue balls. How many ways are there to choose, without replacement, 8 balls from the jar? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
There are $ 17 + 22 = 39 $ balls in total. \\
When it asks to choose without replacement, ball x cannot be picked up again if it is already picked up in the current 8-ball selection. \\
We need to choose 8 balls from the 39 balls: $ \binom{39}{8} $

\subsection{Question 9}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} How many bitstrings of length 33 are there that start with 1010, end with 0101, and contain exactly 11 zeros? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Product Rule (3.1), Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
For something like this, we know that 4 1's are fixed in place and 4 0's are fixed in place. \\
Since the question asks for the number of bitstrings that contain 11 0's and 4 0's have already been set, \\
we need to choose 7 0's from the remaining 25 positions: $ \binom{25}{7} $ \\
Since the remaining bits are forced to be 1's, we don't need to worry about combinations for them.

\subsection{Question 10}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} How many solutions are there to the equation $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 16$, where $x_1 \geq 0, x_2 \geq 0, x_3 \geq 0$ are integers? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Solutions of Linear Equations (3.9.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We can treat this as a stars and bars problem. \\
We have 16 stars and 2 bars. \\
$x_1$ is the number of stars to the left of the first bar \\
$x_2$ is the number of stars between the two bars \\
$x_3$ is the number of stars to the right of the second bar. \\
We just need to pick any 2 of the 18 positions to be bars
Thus, there are $ \binom{16+2}{2} $ solutions.

\subsection{Question 11}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} What is the coefficient of $x^{111}y^{222}$ in the expansion of ${(7x+14y)}^{333}$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Newton’s Binomial Theorem (3.6.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's write it out \\
$ = \sum^{n}_{k} \binom{333}{k} {(7x)}^k {(14y)}^{n-k} $ \\
$ = \sum^{333}_{k=111} \binom{333}{k} {(7x)}^k {(14y)}^{333-111} $ \\
$ = \binom{333}{111} {(7x)}^{111} {(14y)}^{222} $ \\
$ = \binom{333}{111} 7^{111} {14}^{222} x^{111} y^{222}$ \\
Thus, the coefficient is $ \binom{333}{111} 7^{111} {14}^{222} $

\subsection{Question 12}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider the recursive algorithm $ FIB $, which takes as input an integer $n \geq 0$.
When running $FIB(7)$, how many calls are there to $FIB(3)$?
procedure Fib $ (n) $
if n = 0 or n = 1 Then
f=n
else
f = Fib$ (n-1) $ + Fib$ (n-2) $
end if
return f
end procedure
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Recursive Functions (4.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's draw the recursion tree for $FIB(7)$ \\
\begin{forest}
	[FIB$ (7) $
		[FIB$ (6) $
				[FIB$ (5) $
						[FIB$ (4) $
								[FIB$ (3) $]
									[FIB$ (2) $]
							]
							[FIB$ (3) $]
					]
					[FIB$ (4) $
						[FIB$ (3) $]
							[FIB$ (2) $]
					]]
			[FIB$ (5) $
				[FIB$ (4) $
						[FIB$ (3) $]
							[FIB$ (2) $]
					]
					[FIB$ (3) $]
			]
	]
\end{forest} \\
There are 5 calls to $FIB(3)$ in the recursion tree.

\subsection{Question 13}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} The Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows: $f_0 = 0, f_1 = 1$, and $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ for $n \geq 2$.
Consider the recursive algorithm $ FIB $, which takes as input an integer $n \geq 0$. For $n \geq 3$, run algorithm $FIB(n)$ and let $a_n$ be the number of times that $FIB(1)$ is called.
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
To understand why $a_n = f_n$ for the recursive Fibonacci algorithm, let's analyze how the algorithm works and the structure of its recursive calls.
\subsection*{Fibonacci Algorithm (FIB)}
The Fibonacci algorithm $ \text{FIB}(n) $ can be described as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If $ n = 0 $, return 0.
	\item If $ n = 1 $, return 1.
	\item If $ n \geq 2 $, return $ \text{FIB}(n-1) + \text{FIB}(n-2) $.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Analysis of Recursive Calls}
Let's denote $ a_n $ as the number of times $ \text{FIB}(1) $ is called when computing $ \text{FIB}(n) $.

\subsection*{Base Cases}
$ \text{FIB}(0) $:
\begin{itemize}
	\item No recursive calls are made.
	\item $ a_0 = 0 $.
\end{itemize}

$ \text{FIB}(1) $:
\begin{itemize}
	\item  No recursive calls are made.
	\item  $ a_1 = 1 $.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Recursive Cases}
For $ n \geq 2 $:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $ \text{FIB}(n) = \text{FIB}(n-1) + \text{FIB}(n-2) $.
	\item To compute $ \text{FIB}(n-1) $, the number of times $ \text{FIB}(1) $ is called is $ a_{n-1} $.
	\item To compute $ \text{FIB}(n-2) $, the number of times $ \text{FIB}(1) $ is called is $ a_{n-2} $.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, the total number of times $ \text{FIB}(1) $ is called in $ \text{FIB}(n) $ is:
\[ a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} \]

\subsection*{Inductive Hypothesis}
Assume that $ a_k = f_k $ for all $ k \leq n $.

\subsection*{Inductive Step}
To prove $ a_{n+1} = f_{n+1} $:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We know $ a_n = f_n $ and $ a_{n-1} = f_{n-1} $ by the inductive hypothesis.
	\item Using the recurrence relation derived above:
	      \[ a_{n+1} = a_n + a_{n-1} \]
	\item Substituting the values from the hypothesis:
	      \[ a_{n+1} = f_n + f_{n-1} \]
\end{itemize}

By the definition of Fibonacci numbers:
\[ f_{n+1} = f_n + f_{n-1} \]

Thus:
\[ a_{n+1} = f_{n+1} \]

\subsection*{Conclusion}
By induction, we have shown that for all $ n \geq 0 $, the number of times $ \text{FIB}(1) $ is called in $ \text{FIB}(n) $ is equal to $ f_n $.

Hence, $ a_n = f_n $.

\subsection{Question 14}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} The Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows: $f_0 = 0, f_1 = 1$, and $f_{n+1} = f_{n-1} + f_n$ for $n \geq 1$. Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Warning: Later
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $n \geq 1: f^{2}_1 + f^{2}_2 + f^{2}_3 + ... + f^{2}_n = (f_n)^{2}$
	\item $n \geq 1: f^{2}_1 + f^{2}_2 + f^{2}_3 + ... + f^{2}_n = f_{n-1}f_n$
	\item $n \geq 1: f^{2}_1 + f^{2}_2 + f^{2}_3 + ... + f^{2}_n = f_{n}f_{n+1}$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 15}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider the following recursive function:
$f(0) = 7$,
$f(n+1) = f(n) + 6n + 1$ for all integers $n \geq 0$.
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Recursive Functions (4.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's calculate the first few values of $f(n)$ to find a pattern: \\
$f(0) = 7$ \\
$f(1) = 7 + 6 \cdot 0 + 1 = 8$
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For all $ n \geq 0: f(n) = 2n^{2} + 2n + 7 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 2 \cdot 1^{2} + 2 \cdot 1 + 7 = 2 + 2 + 7 = 11 $
	\item For all $ n \geq 0: f(n) = 3n^{2} + 2n + 7 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 3 \cdot 1^{2} + 2 \cdot 1 + 7 = 3 + 2 + 7 = 12 $
	\item For all $ n \geq 0: f(n) = 2n^{2} - 2n + 7 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 2 \cdot 1^{2} - 2 \cdot 1 + 7 = 2 - 2 + 7 = 7 $
	\item For all $ n \geq 0: f(n) = 3n^{2} - 2n + 7 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 3 \cdot 1^{2} - 2 \cdot 1 + 7 = 3 - 2 + 7 = 8 $
\end{enumerate}
Because d is the only answer that matches the first value of $f(n)$, it is the correct answer.

\subsection{Question 16}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $A = \{ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100 \} $. We choose a uniformly random element $x$ in $A$ and, independently, choose a uniformly random element $y$ in $A$. What is the probability that $x = y$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Uniform Probability Spaces (4.3), Independent Events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$ |S| = 100 \cdot 100 $ \\
Let A = Event that $x = y$ \\
There are 100 ways for $x$ to be equal to $y$ when $ {1=1 , 2=2 , \ldots , 99=99 , 100=100} $. \\
$ |A| = 100 $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{100}{100 \cdot 100} $

\subsection{Question 17}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We flip a fair coin (independently) 100 times. What is the probability that the coin comes up heads exactly 37 times? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Determining the Expected Value (6.7.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X$ be the random variable whose value is the number of times the coin comes up heads. \\
$X$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n = 100$ and $p = 0.5$. \\
$ \Pr(X = 37) = \binom{100}{37} \cdot 0.5^{37} \cdot 0.5^{100-37} $ \\
$ \Pr(X = 37) = \binom{100}{37} {(\frac{1}{2})}^{100} $ \\
We can also view it intuitively \\
Let S = Set of all possible outcomes \\
$ |S| = 2^{100} $ \\
Let A = Set of outcomes where the coin comes up heads exactly 37 times \\
We choose 37 of the 100 coin flips to be heads: $ \binom{100}{37} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{\binom{100}{37}}{2^{100}} $

\subsection{Question 18}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Assume you answer the first question in this exam by choosing one of the four answers uniformly at random.
You answer the second question by choosing, again uniformly at random, one of the three answers you did not choose in the first question.
What is the probability that you answer the second question correctly? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Basic Rules of Probability (5.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Well, there are 4 answers for the second question, and only 1 of them is correct. \\
Thus, the probability that you answer the second question correctly is $ \frac{1}{4} $.

\subsection{Question 19}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A jar contains 7 red balls and 9 blue balls. We choose, uniformly at random and without replacement, 5 balls. Let $A$ be the event
$A = $ \enquote{exactly 2 of the balls are red or exactly 3 of the balls are blue}.
What is $\Pr(A)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), Uniform Probability Spaces (5.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$ |S| = \binom{16}{5} $ \\
Well, this is kind of an odd question. \\
It's asking for for 2 red balls or 3 blue balls, but you can only have 2 red balls when you have 3 blue balls. \\
First, we choose 2 red balls: $ \binom{7}{2} $ \\
Then, we choose 3 blue balls: $ \binom{9}{3} $ \\
$ |A| = \binom{7}{2} \cdot \binom{9}{3}$ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{\binom{7}{2} \cdot \binom{9}{3}}{\binom{16}{5}} $

\subsection{Question 20}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A jar contains 7 red balls and 9 blue balls. We choose, uniformly at random and without replacement, 3 balls. Define the following two events:
$A = $ \enquote{exactly 2 of the balls are red} \\
$B = $ \enquote{the number of red balls is even} \\
What is the conditional probability $\Pr(A|B)$? (Recall that 0 is even.) \\ Conditional Probability \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), Conditional Probability (5.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$A$ occurs when we choose 2 of the 7 red balls and 1 of the 9 blue balls \\
$|A| = \binom{7}{2} \cdot \binom{9}{1} $ \\
$B$ occurs when either of the following happens: \\
0 red balls and 3 blue balls: $ \binom{7}{0} \cdot \binom{9}{3} $ \\
2 red balls and 1 blue ball: $ \binom{7}{2} \cdot \binom{9}{1} $ \\
$ |B| = \binom{7}{0} \cdot \binom{9}{3} + \binom{7}{2} \cdot \binom{9}{1} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\binom{7}{2} \cdot \binom{9}{1}}{\binom{7}{0} \cdot \binom{9}{3} + \binom{7}{2} \cdot \binom{9}{1}} $

\subsection{Question 21}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Assume that a newborn baby is a girl with probability $p$ and a boy with probability $1-p$. Also assume that the genders of different newborns are independent of each other. Consider a person who has two children. Define the following two events:
$A = $ \enquote{both children are girls}
$B = $ \enquote{at least one of the children is a girl}
What is the conditional probability $\Pr(A|B)$? Conditional Probability \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Product Rule (3.1), The Complement Rule(3.3), The Sum Rule (3.4), Conditional Probability (5.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$ \Pr(A) = p \cdot p $ \\
We can calculate $B$ in two ways
\begin{enumerate}
	\item B is when neither are girls$($both are boys$)$ \\
	      $ |B| = 1 - (1-p) \cdot (1-p) $ \\
	      $ |B| = 1 - (1 - 2p + p^2) $ \\
	      $ |B| = 2p - p^2 $
	\item B is when the first is a boy and the second is a girl, the first is a girl and the second is a boy, or both are girls \\
	      $ |B| = (1-p) \cdot p + p \cdot (1-p) + p \cdot p $ \\
	      $ |B| = p - p^2 + p - p^2 + p^2 $ \\
	      $ |B| = 2p - p^2 $
\end{enumerate}$B$ occurs when neither children are boys
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{p \cdot p}{2p - p^2} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{p}{2 - p} $

\subsection{Question 22}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We flip a fair coin (independently) three times. Define the following two events:
$A = $ \enquote{the number of tails is odd}
$B = $ \enquote{the first coin comes up heads}
True or false: The events $A$ and $B$ are independent.
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Independent Events (5.11)\\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
B occurs when the first coin comes up heads, so $\Pr(B) = \frac{1}{2} $ \\
A occurs when we get 1 or 3 heads: $\Pr(A) = \frac{4}{8} $ because $ {THH, HTH, HHT, TTT } $ \\
A and B occur when the first coin is heads and the second or third coin is tails but not both:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item HTH \\
	      $\Pr(HTH) = \frac{1}{8} $
	\item HHT
	      $\Pr(HHT) = \frac{1}{8} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{4} = \frac{4}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4} $ \\
Thus, the events $A$ and $B$ are independent.

\subsection{Question 23}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We flip a fair coin (independently) three times. Define the following two events:
$A = $ \enquote{the number of tails is odd}
$B = $ \enquote{the number of heads is even}
True or false: The events $A$ and $B$ are independent. (Recall that 0 is even.)
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Independent Events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$ |S| = 2^3 = 8 $ \\
Calculate $A$ and $B$
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ A = \{TTT, THH, HTH, HHT\} $ \\
	      $ |A| = 4 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item $ B = \{TTT, THH, HTH, HHT\} $ \\
	      $ |B| = 4 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} $
\end{enumerate}
Calculate $A \cap B$ \\
$ A \cap B = \{TTT, THH, HTH, HHT\} $ \\
$ |A \cap B| = 4 $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} $ \\
Now we can check if $A$ and $B$ are independent \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} $ \\
Thus, the events $A$ and $B$ are not independent.

\subsection{Question 24}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We flip a fair coin (independently) two times. Define the following three events:
$A = $ \enquote{the number of heads is odd}
$B = $ \enquote{the first coin comes up heads}
$C = $ \enquote{the second coin comes up tails}
True or false: The events $A, B$ and $C$ are independent.
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Independent Events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$ |S| = 2^2 = 4 $ \\
Calculate $A, B, C$
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ A = \{HT, TH\} $ \\
	      $ |A| = 2 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item $ B = \{HH, HT\} $ \\
	      $ |B| = 2 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item $ C = \{HT, TT\} $ \\
	      $ |C| = 2 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(C) = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} $
\end{enumerate}
Calculate $A \cap B, A \cap C, B \cap C$ \\
$ A \cap B \cap C = \{HT\} $ \\
$ |A \cap B \cap C| = 1 $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B \cap C) = \frac{1}{4} $ \\
Now we can check if $A, B, C$ are independent \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B \cap C) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) \cdot \Pr(C) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8} $ \\
Thus, the events $A, B, C$ are not independent.

\subsection{Question 25}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $X$ be a random variable with probability distribution $\Pr(X=0) = 1/2, \Pr(X=1) = 1/2, \Pr(X=2) = 1/4, \Pr(X=3) = 1/6$.
What is the expected value $E(X)$ of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Expected Values (6.4)\\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$ E(X) = 0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{6} $ \\
$ E(X) = 0 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ E(X) = \frac{3}{2} $

\subsection{Question 26}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} True or false: If $X$ and $Y$ are random variables, then $E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y)$, even if $X$ and $Y$ are not independent.
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Linearity of Expectations (6.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
The linearity of expectation states that $ E(X+Y) = E(X) + E(Y) $ holds for any random variables $ X $ and $Y$ regardless of whether they are independent.

\subsection{Question 27}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We flip a fair coin (independently) three times. Let $X$ be the random variable whose value is the number of times the coin comes up heads. What is the expected value $E(X)$ of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $X=0 = \{TTT\} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=0) = \frac{1}{8} $
	\item $X=1 = \{HTT, THT, TTH\} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=1) = \frac{3}{8} $
	\item $X=2 = \{HHT, HTH, THH\} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=2) = \frac{3}{8} $
	\item $X=3 = \{HHH\} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=3) = \frac{1}{8} $
\end{enumerate}
$ E(X) = 0 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 1 \cdot \frac{3}{8} + 2 \cdot \frac{3}{8} + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{8} $ \\
$ E(X) = 0 + \frac{3}{8} + \frac{6}{8} + \frac{3}{8} $ \\
$ E(X) = \frac{12}{8} = \frac{3}{2} $

\subsection{Question 28}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a coin that comes up heads with probability $p$ and tails with probability $1-p$. We flip this coin (independently) and stop as soon as it comes up heads for the fifth time. Let $X$ be the random variable whose value is the total number of times we flip the coin. What is the expected value $E(X)$ of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Determining the Expected Value (6.6.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
The formula to determine the average number of flips to get a head is $ \frac{1}{p} $ \\
Thus, the expected value of $X$ is $ \frac{1}{p} \cdot 5 $

\subsection{Question 29}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A jar contains 17 red balls and 5 blue balls. Repeat the following 12 times: Choose one ball uniformly at random (and leave it in the jar). Let $X$ be the random variable whose value is the number of blue balls that we choose. What is the expected value $E(X)$ of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Indicator Random Variables (6.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let A = Event that we choose a blue ball \\
Let $X_i$ be the random variable whose value is 1 if we choose a blue ball on the $i$th draw and 0 otherwise. \\
$ \Pr(X_i=1) = \frac{5}{17+5} = \frac{5}{22} $ \\
$ E(X) = 12 \cdot \frac{5}{22} $ \\
$ E(X) = \frac{60}{22} $ \\
$ E(X) = \frac{30}{11} $

\subsection{Question 30}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A group of $n \geq 3$ people is sitting at a round table, so that each person has two neighbors, one clockwise neighbor and one counter-clockwise neighbor. \\
Each person flips a fair and independent coin. \\
A person starts singing if and only if (i) his coin comes up heads, (ii) the coin of his clockwise neighbor comes up tails, and (iii) the coin of his counter-clockwise neighbor comes up tails. \\
Let $X$ be the random variable whose value is the number of people that are singing. What is the expected value $E(X)$ of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Indicator Random Variables (6.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X_i$ be the random variable whose value is 1 if person $i$ is singing and 0 otherwise. \\
$X_i = 1$ if and only if the coin of person $i$ comes up heads, the coin of person $i-1$ comes up tails, and the coin of person $i+1$ comes up tails. \\
$E(X_i) = \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} $ \\
$E(X) = E(X_1) + E(X_2) + \text{\ldots} + E(X_n) $ \\
$E(X) = n \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{n}{8} $

\subsection{Question 31}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} True or false: If $X$ and $Y$ are random variables, then
$ E( \text{max}(X,Y) ) = \text{max}(E(X), E(Y)) $.
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Linearity of Expectations (6.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
This is false because the expected value of the maximum of two random variables is not necessarily equal to the maximum of the expected values of the two random variables.

\subsection{Question 32}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $K_n$ be the complete graph on $n$ vertices, in which each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. For each edge $e$ of $K_n$, we flip a fair and independent coin; if the coin comes up heads, we color $e$ red, if it comes up tails, we color $e$ blue.
Assume that the vertex set of $K_n$ is ${1, 2, 3, \ldots, n}$. Let $K'$ be the subgraph of $K_n$ induced by the vertices $1, 2, \ldots, k$ (i.e., an edge $(i,j)$ of $K_n$ is in $K'$ if and only if both $i$ and $j$ are at most $k$). Let $A$ be the event
$A = $ \enquote{all edges of $K'$ have the same color}
What is $\Pr(A)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Bijection Rule (3.2.1), Uniform Probability Spaces (4.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S = Set of all possible subgraphs \\
	      So to determine the set of all possible subgraphs, we need to determine how many vertices are in the subgraph. \\
	      We know there are $k$ vertices in the subgraph \\
	      In other words, we choose $k$ out of the $n$ vertices from $K_n$ to use in $K'$: $ \binom{n}{k} $ \\
	      $ |S| = 2^{\binom{k}{2}} $
	\item Let's determine A \\
	      All the edges can either be red OR all the edges can be blue: 2 ways \\
	      $ |A| = 2 $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{2}{2^{\binom{k}{2}}} $

\subsection{Question 33}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a multiple choice exam with 100 questions, in which for each question, four options are given to choose from. You answer each question by choosing an answer uniformly at random, and independently of the other answers. What is the expected number of correct answers? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Determining the Expected Value (6.7.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Okay. So we're just supposed to calculate the expected value \\
Means we sum the probability of getting 0 questions correct, 1 answer correct, \ldots, to 100 answers correct
Let X be the number of questions we get right or something \\
The probability of getting any question correct is $ \frac{1}{4} $ \\
The probability of getting any question wrong is $ \frac{3}{4} $ \\
$X \sim \text{Binomial}(100, 1/4)$ \\
$ \Pr(X=k) = \binom{100}{k} \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^{k} \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^{100-k} $ \\
Now, we do this when $k$ is 0 to 100 \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{k=0}^{100} k \cdot \Pr(X=k) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{k=0}^{100} k \cdot \binom{100}{k} \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^{k} \left( \frac{3}{4} \right)^{100-k} $

\subsection{Question 1}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A password consists of 13 characters \\
Each character is one of the ten digits $ 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9 $. \\
A password must contain exactly one odd digit. How many passwords are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Complement Rule (3.3), Sum Rule (3.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
First, we choose the odd digit from $ \{ 1,3,5,7,9 \} $: $5 \text{ ways} $ \\
Then, we choose which position to place the odd digit: $ \binom{13}{1} \text{ ways} $ \\
Finally, we choose which of the following 5 event digits for the remaining 12 digits: $ 5^{12} \text{ ways} $ \\
$ 5 \cdot \binom{13}{1} \cdot 5^{12} $ \\
$ 13 \cdot 5^{13} $

\subsection{Question 2}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A password consists of 13 characters \\
Eeach character is one of the ten digits $0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9$. \\
A password must contain at least one odd digit and at most two even digits. How many passwords are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Complement Rule (3.3), Sum Rule (3.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A = Event that the password contains 0 event digits \\
	      Since every digit is odd, each of the 13 digits must be chosen from the set \{1,3,5,7,9\} \\
	      $ |A| = 5^{13} $
	\item B = Event that the password contains 1 event digit \\
	      Since 1 of the digits is even, there are 13 positions to place the single even digit: $ \binom{13}{1} $ \\
	      Since the 1 even digit can be chosen from the set \{0,2,4,6,8\}, there are 5 choices for the even digit: $ 5 $ \\
	      The remaining 12 digits must be chosen from the set \{1,3,5,7,9\}, so there are $ 5^{12} $ ways to choose the remaining digits \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{13}{1} \cdot 5 \cdot 5^{12} $
	\item  C = Event that the password contains 2 event digits \\
	      Since 2 of the digits are even, there are $ \binom{13}{2} $ ways to choose the 2 positions for the even digits \\
	      Since the 2 even digits can be chosen from the set \{0,2,4,6,8\}, each digit has 5 choices: $ 5^2 $ \\
	      The remaining 11 digits must be chosen from the set \{1,3,5,7,9\}, so there are $ 5^{11} $ ways to choose the remaining digits \\
	      $ |C| = \binom{13}{2} \cdot 5^2 \cdot 5^{11} $
\end{enumerate}
$ |A| + |B| + |C| = 5^{13} + \binom{13}{1} \cdot 5 \cdot 5^{12} + \binom{13}{2} \cdot 5^2 \cdot 5^{11} $ \\
$ |A| + |B| + |C| = 5^{13} + 13 \cdot 5^{13} + \binom{13}{2} \cdot 5^{13} $

\subsection{Question 4}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} How many bitstings of length 13 start with 010 or end with 11?
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A = Event that the bitstring starts with 010 \\
	      Since the bitstring starts with 010, the first 3 digits must be 010 \\
	      The remaining 10 digits can be chosen from the set \{0,1\}, so there are $ 2^{10} $ ways to choose the remaining digits \\
	      $ |A| = 2^{10} $
	\item B = Event that the bitstring ends with 11 \\
	      Since the bitstring ends with 11, the last 2 digits must be 11 \\
	      The remaining 11 digits can be chosen from the set \{0,1\}, so there are $ 2^{11} $ ways to choose the remaining digits \\
	      $ |B| = 2^{11} $
	\item $ A \cap B $ = Event that the bitstring starts with 010 and ends with 11 \\
	      Since the bitstring starts with 010 and ends with 11, the first 3 digits must be 010 and the last 2 digits must be 11 \\
	      The remaining 8 digits can be chosen from the set \{0,1\}, so there are $ 2^8 $ ways to choose the remaining digits \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 2^8 $
\end{enumerate}
$ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = 2^{10} + 2^{11} - 2^8 $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = 1 \cdot 2^{10} + 2 \cdot 2^{10} - 2^8$ \\
$ |A \cup B| = (1+2) \cdot 2^{10} - 2^8 $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = 3 \cdot 2^{10} - 2^8 $

\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } A Recursively Defined Set (4.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's write out all recursive cases for $S_n$
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $0, S_{n-1} $
	\item $1, 0, S_{n-2} $
\end{enumerate}
$S_n = S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} $

	\item 30 like the course COMP 2804,
	\item 50 do not like 8:30am classes and do not like the course COMP 2804.
\end{enumerate}
How many students in this group like 8:30am classes and like the course COMP 2804? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5), De Morgan's Law (no corresponding chapter) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
A = Like 8:30am classes \\
$ |A| = 40 $ \\
B = Like COMP 2804 \\
$ |B| = 30 $ \\
$ |\overline{A \cup B}| = 50 $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = 100-50 $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = 50 $ \\
$ |A \cap B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cup B| $ \\
$ |A \cap B| = 40 + 30 - 50 $ \\
$ |A \cap B| = 20 $

\subsection{Question 7}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider $m \geq 7$ blue balls $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_m$ and $n \geq 7$ red balls $R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_n$. \\
We pick 7 balls of the same color and arrange them on a horizontal line. (The order on the line matters.) How many arrangements are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Product Rule (3.1), Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Sum Rule (3.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
A = Event that we pick 7 blue balls \\
First, we choose 7 of the m blue balls: $ \binom{m}{7} $ \\
The first ball has 7 choices, the second ball has 6 choices, the third ball has 5 choices, and so on until the seventh ball has 1 choice: $ 7! $ \\
$ |A| = \binom{m}{7} \cdot 7! $ \\
B = Event that we pick 7 red balls \\
First, we choose 7 of the n red balls: $ \binom{n}{7} $ \\
The first ball has 7 choices, the second ball has 6 choices, the third ball has 5 choices, and so on until the seventh ball has 1 choice: $ 7! $ \\
$ |B| = \binom{n}{7} \cdot 7! $ \\
$ |A| + |B| = \binom{m}{7} \cdot 7! + \binom{n}{7} \cdot 7! $

\subsection{Question 8}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} The number of different strings that can be made by reordering the 10 letters of the word AAABBCCCCC is
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A 3
	\item B 2
	\item C 5
\end{enumerate}
$ \binom{10}{3} \cdot \binom{7}{2} \cdot \binom{5}{5} $ \\
$ \frac{10!}{3!7!} \cdot \frac{7!}{2!5!} \cdot \frac{5!}{5!0!} $ \\
$ \frac{10!}{3!1} \cdot \frac{1}{2!5!} \cdot \frac{1}{1 \cdot 1} $ \\
$ \frac{10!}{3!2!5!} $

\subsection{Question 9}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} How many solutions are there to the equation $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 13$, where $x_1 \geq 0, x_2 \geq 0, x_3 \geq 0$ are integers? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Solutions of Linear Equations (3.9.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We can solve this using stars and bars approach\\
There are 13 stars and 2 extra positions to place the bars/dividers between rows of stars
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The number of stars to the left of the first bar is $x_1$
	\item The number of stars between the first and second bars is $x_2$
	\item The number of stars to the right of the second bar is $x_3$
\end{enumerate}
As a result, we pick 2 positions out of 13 and 2 positions to place the bars: $ \binom{15}{2} $

\subsection{Question 10}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider the following recursive function:
$f(0) = -17$,
$f(n) = f(n-1) + 8n - 2$ for all integers $n \geq 1$.
Which of the following is true for all $n \geq 0$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Recursive Functions (4.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's calculate $f(1)$ first \\
$f(1) = f(0) + 8 \cdot 1 - 2 $ \\
$f(1) = -17 + 8 - 2 $ \\
$f(1) = -11 $
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ f(n) = 3n^{2} - n - 17 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 3 \cdot 1^2 - 1 - 17 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 3 - 1 - 17 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = -15 $
	\item $ f(n) = 3n^{2} + n - 17 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 3 \cdot 1^2 + 1 - 17 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 3 + 1 - 17 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = -13 $
	\item $ f(n) = 4n^{2} - 2n - 17 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 4 \cdot 1^2 - 2 - 17 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 4 - 2 - 17 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = -15 $
	\item $ f(n) = 4n^{2} + 2n - 17 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 4 \cdot 1^2 + 2 - 17 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 4 + 2 - 17 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = -11 $
\end{enumerate}
The correct answer is $ f(n) = 4n^{2} + 2n - 17 $ because it is the only one that gives the correct value for $ f(1) $

\subsection{Question 11}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider the following recursive algorithm $ FIB $, which takes as input an integer $n \geq 0$. \\
If we run algorithm $FIB(20)$, how many calls are there to $FIB(16)$? \\
procedure $FIB(n)$ \\
if n = 0 or n = 1 then \\
f=n \\
else f = FIB$(n-1)$ + FIB$(n-2)$ \\
end if \\
return $f$ \\
end procedure \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Recursive Functions (4.1) \\

\subsection{Question 12}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A bowl contains 5 blue balls, 4 red balls, and 6 green balls. We choose 2 balls uniformly at random. \\
What is the probability that these 2 balls have the same color? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Sum Rule (3.4), Uniform Probability Spaces (4.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A = Event that both balls are blue \\
	      A occurs when we choose 2 of the 5 blue balls \\
	      $ |A| = \binom{5}{2} $
	\item Let B = Event that both balls are red \\
	      B occurs when we choose 2 of the 4 red balls \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{4}{2} $
	\item Let C = Event that both balls are green \\
	      C occurs when we choose 2 of the 6 green balls \\
	      $ |C| = \binom{6}{2} $

	      S occurs when we choose 2 of the 15 balls \\
	      $ |S| = \binom{15}{2} $
\end{enumerate}
$ |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| $ \\
$ |A \cup B \cup C| = \binom{5}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{6}{2} $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cup B \cup C) = \frac{\binom{5}{2} + \binom{4}{2} + \binom{6}{2}}{\binom{15}{2}} $

\subsection{Question 13}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Annie, Boris, and Charlie have random and independent birthdays. \\
(We ignore leap years, so that a year has 365 days.) \\
What is the probability that Annie, Boris, and Charlie have the same birthday? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Birthday Paradox (5.5), The Law of Total Probability (5.9) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let A = Event that Annie, Boris, and Charlie have the same birthday \\
Annie has a birthday on any of the 365 days: 365 \\
Boris would only then have a birthday on the same day as Annie: 1 \\
Charlie would only then have a birthday on the same day as Annie and Boris: 1 \\
$ |A| = 365 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 $ \\
Let S = All possible outcomes \\
$ |S| = 365^3 $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{365}{365^3} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{1}{365^2} $

\subsection{Question 14}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We flip a fair coin repeatedly and independently, resulting in a sequence of heads $(H)$ and tails $(T)$. \\
We stop flipping the coin as soon as this sequence contains one $H$ or eight $T$s. \\
What is the probability that this sequence contains at most 7 $T$s? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } the Complement Rule (3.3), Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's go through each option and explain
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $1 - (1/2)^{7}$ \\
	      This is just the complement rule, which usually works but they're subtracting the probability that we get 6 tails followed by a head \\
	      It might've worked if they were subtracting the probability that we get 7 tails followed by a head from the whole set of possibilities
	\item $\sum_{k=0}^{7} (1/2)^{k}$ \\
	      This one is wrong because it starts at $ { \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)}^0 $ but it doesn't take into account the fact that we have to flip a head to stop, which has a probability of $ \frac{1}{2} $
	\item $\sum_{k=0}^{7} (1/2)^{k+1}$ \\
	      This one is beautiful \\
	      It says, probability of flipping a heads right away, probability of flipping a tails folloewd by a heads, probability of flipping 2 tails followed by a heads, and so on until 7 tails followed by a heads

	      B occurs when we choose 2 of the 5 blue balls or 2 of the 4 red balls \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{5}{2} + \binom{4}{2} $
	\item Let $A \cap B$ = Event that both balls are red and both balls have the same color \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = \binom{4}{2} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\binom{4}{2}}{\binom{5}{2} + \binom{4}{2}} $

\subsection{Question 16}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We choose an element $x$ uniformly at random from the set ${1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10}$. Define the events

$B = $ \enquote{$x$ is divisible by 3}.
What is the conditional probability $\Pr(A|B)$? Conditional Probability

\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}

	      A occurs when we choose an even number from the set ${2, 4, 6, 8, 10}$ \\
	      $ |A| = 5 $
	\item Let B = Event that $x$ is divisible by 3 \\
	      B occurs when we choose a number from the set ${3, 6, 9}$ \\
	      $ |B| = 3 $
	\item Let $A \cap B$ = Event that $x$ is even and divisible by 3 \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 1 $

$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{1}{3} $

\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We choose an element $x$ uniformly at random from the set ${1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10}$. Define the events
$A = $ \enquote{$x$ is even},
and
$B = $ \enquote{$1 \leq x \leq 5$}.
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Independent Events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S = All possible outcomes \\
	      $ |S| = 10 $
	\item A occurs when we choose an even number from the set ${2, 4, 6, 8, 10}$ \\
	      $ |A| = 5 $ \\
	      $\Pr(A) = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item B occurs when we choose a number from the set ${1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$ \\
	      $ |B| = 5 $ \\
	      $\Pr(B) = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item $A \cap B$ occurs when we choose an even number from the set ${2, 4}$ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 2 $ \\
	      $\Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{4} $ \\
Because the equation is false, these events are not independent.

\subsection{Question 18}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We choose an element $x$ uniformly at random from the set ${1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10}$. Define the events
$A = $ \enquote{$x$ is even},
and
$B = $ \enquote{$1 \leq x \leq 6$}.
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Independent Events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S = All possible outcomes \\
	      $ |S| = 10 $
	\item A occurs when we choose an even number from the set ${2, 4, 6, 8, 10}$ \\
	      $ |A| = 5 $ \\
	      $\Pr(A) = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item B occurs when we choose a number from the set ${1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}$ \\
	      $ |B| = 6 $ \\
	      $\Pr(B) = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5} $
	\item $A \cap B$ occurs when we choose an even number from the set ${2, 4, 6}$ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 3 $ \\
	      $\Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{3}{10} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{3}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{5} $ \\
$ \frac{3}{10} = \frac{3}{10} $ \\
Because the equation is true, these events are independent.

\subsection{Question 19}
When a couple has a child, this child is a boy with probability $ \frac{1}{2} $ and a girl with probability $ \frac{1}{2} $, independent of the gender of previous children. A couple stops having children as soon as they have a child that has the same gender as their first child. Define the events:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $ A = $ \enquote{the second child is a boy},
	\item $ B = $ \enquote{the couple has at least three children and the third child is a boy}.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Independent Events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We need to determine if events $ A $ and $ B $ are independent.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ \Pr(A) = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item If they have at least 3 kids and the third child is a boy, let's calculate what's needed to get there \\
	      Boy, Girl, Boy: $ \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} $ \\
	      Girl, Boy, Boy: $ \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} $
	\item $ \Pr(A \cap B) $ now \\
	      If the second child is a boy and we want them to keep pumping out babies, then the first two children must be of different genders \\
	      That leaves us with Girl, Boy, Boy: $ \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{8} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's check if $ \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) = \Pr(A \cap B) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{8} $ \\
The events $ A $ and $ B $ are independent. Thus, the statement is true.

\subsection{Question 21}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} I flip two fair and independent coins. \\
If the first coin comes up tails, you lose \$1. \\
That means you win -\$1. \\
If the second coin comes up heads, you win \$2. \\
Thus, if the first coin comes up tails and the second coin comes up heads, you win \$1 \\
Define the random variable $X$ to be the amount of dollars that you win. What is the expected value of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Indicator Random Variables (6.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\subsection*{Step-by-Step Solution}

1. **Possible Outcomes and Corresponding Values:**
There are four possible outcomes when flipping two fair coins:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First coin is heads (H), second coin is heads (H): $(H, H)$
	\item First coin is heads (H), second coin is tails (T): $(H, T)$
	\item First coin is tails (T), second coin is heads (H): $(T, H)$
	\item First coin is tails (T), second coin is tails (T): $(T, T)$
\end{itemize}

2. **Winning Amount for Each Outcome:**
For each outcome, we determine the amount $ X $ that you win:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $(H, H)$: The first coin is heads, so we don't lose. The second coin is heads, so we win 1 dollar. Thus, $ X = 1 $.
	\item $(H, T)$: The first coin is heads, so we don't lose. The second coin is tails, so we don't win. Thus, $ X = 0 $.
	\item $(T, H)$: The first coin is tails, so we lose (i.e., we win $-1$ dollars). The second coin is heads, so we win 1 dollar, but since the first coin being tails means we lose, this overrides the second coin's result. Thus, $ X = -1 $.
	\item $(T, T)$: The first coin is tails, so we lose (i.e., we win $-1$ dollars). The second coin is tails, so we don't win. Thus, $ X = -1 $.
\end{itemize}

3. **Calculate the Expected Value $ E(X) $:**
The expected value $ E(X) $ is calculated using the formula:
\[
	E(X) = \sum_{i} P(X = x_i) \cdot x_i
\]
Each of the four outcomes has a probability of $ \frac{1}{4} $, as the coins are fair and independent.
Therefore, we have:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $ P(X = 1) = \frac{1}{4} $ (from the $(H, H)$ outcome)
	\item $ P(X = 0) = \frac{1}{4} $ (from the $(H, T)$ outcome)
	\item $ P(X = -1) = \frac{1}{2} $ (from the $(T, H)$ and $(T, T)$ outcomes combined)
\end{itemize}

4. **Substitute the Values into the Expected Value Formula:**
\[
	E(X) = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + (-1) \cdot \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
	E(X) = \frac{1}{4} + 0 - \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
	E(X) = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{2}{4}
\]
\[
	E(X) = -\frac{1}{4}
\]

Therefore, the expected value of $ X $ is $ \boxed{-\frac{1}{4}} $.

\subsection{Question 22}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} I flip a fair coin, independently, 6 times, resulting in a sequence of heads $(H)$ and tails $(T)$.
For each (consecutive) $HTH$ in this sequence, you win 5 dollars.
Define the random variable $X$ to be the amount of dollars that you win.
For example, if the sequence is $ THTHTH $, then $ X = 10 $. What is the expected value of $ X $? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\subsection*{Step-by-Step Solution}
1. **Probability of Getting $ HTH $:**
The probability of getting a head followed by a tail followed by a head in three consecutive flips is:
\[
	P(HTH) = P(H) \times P(T) \times P(H) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{8}
\]
2. **Number of Possible $ HTH $ in 6 Flips:**
Since we are looking for consecutive $ HTH $ patterns, we need to consider overlapping patterns in the sequence.
In a sequence of 6 coin flips, the positions where a $ HTH $ can start are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1st position: $ \{1, 2, 3\} $
	\item 2nd position: $ \{2, 3, 4\} $
	\item 3rd position: $ \{3, 4, 5\} $
	\item 4th position: $ \{4, 5, 6\} $
\end{itemize}
Therefore, there are 4 possible positions for a $ HTH $ to occur.
3. **Expected Value Contribution from Each Position:**
For each position, the expected value contribution is:
\[
	E(\text{one } HTH) = P(HTH) \times \text{payout} = \frac{1}{8} \times 5 = \frac{5}{8}
\]
4. **Total Expected Value $ E(X) $:**
Since there are 4 possible positions, the total expected value is the sum of the contributions from each position:
\[
	E(X) = 4 \times \frac{5}{8} = \frac{20}{8} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
Therefore, the expected value of $ X $ is $ \boxed{\frac{5}{2}} $.

\subsection{Question 23}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider the following recursive algorithm $THEO$, which takes as input a positive integer $k$.
You run algorithm $THEO(1)$, i.e., with $k = 1$.
Define the random variable $X$ to be the value of the output of this algorithm. What is the expected value of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Determining the Expected Value (6.6.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
So um, this algorithm pretty much counts the number of attempts we make until we get $HHH$ or $TTT$ \\
We have a $ \frac{1}{8} $ chance of flipping an $HHH$ \\
We have a $ \frac{1}{8} $ chance of flipping an $TTT$ \\
This gives us a $ \frac{1}{4} $ chance of flipping either $HHH$ or $TTT$ \\
By the geometric distribution, the expected value of the number of attempts until we get a success is $ \frac{1}{p} $ \\
Therefore, the expected value of $X$ is $ \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}} = 4 $

\subsection{Question 24}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We flip a fair coin independently $n$ times. Define the random variable
$X = $ twice the number of heads minus three times the number of tails.
What is the expected value of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A be the event that we flip a head \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item Let B be the event that we flip a tail \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{1}{2} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \mathbb{E}(X) =	2 \cdot \mathbb{E}(\text{number of heads}) - 3 \cdot \mathbb{E}(\text{number of tails}) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 2 \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{n} \Pr(A) - 3 \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{n} \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 2 \cdot n \cdot \frac{1}{2} - 3 \cdot n \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = n - \frac{3}{2}n $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{2n}{2} - \frac{3n}{2} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{-n}{2} $








\section{2014 Winter Final}
\subsection{Question 1}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A password consists of 28 characters, each character being a lowercase letter. \\
A password must contain exactly one vowel (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u). How many passwords are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Complement Rule (3.3), Sum Rule (3.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
The vowel has 5 possible outcomes$ \{ a,e,i,o,u \} $: $ 5 $ \\
It must choose 1 of the 28 character positions: $ 28 $ \\
The remaining 27 lowercasebconsonants each have 21 possible outcomes \\
$ \{ b,c,d,f,g,h,j,k,l,m,n,p,q,r,s,t,v,w,x,y,z \} $: $ 21^{27} $ \\
The total number of passwords is the product of these outcomes: $ 5 \times 28 \times 21^{27} $

\subsection{Question 2}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A password consists of 10 characters, each character being a lowercase letter or a digit. \\
A password must contain at least one digit and at most three digits. How many passwords are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Complement Rule (3.3), Sum Rule (3.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $ A $ be the set of passwords with one digit \\
	      There are $ 10 $ ways to choose the position of the digit: 10 \\
	      The digit has $ 10 $ possible outcomes $ ( \{ 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 \} ) $: 10 \\
	      The remaining 9 characters each have 26 possible outcomes \\
	      $ ( \{ a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z \} )$: $26^9 $ \\
	      $ |A| = 10 \times 10 \times 26^9 $
	\item Let $ B $ be the set of passwords with two digits \\
	      There are 10 positions to choose 2 digits: $ \binom{10}{2} $ \\
	      The two digits combined have $ 10 \times 10 $ possible outcomes: $10^2$ \\
	      The remaining 8 characters each have 26 possible outcomes: $ 26^8 $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{10}{2} \times 10^2 \times 26^8 $
	\item Let $ C $ be the set of passwords with three digits \\
	      There are 10 positions to choose 3 digits: $ \binom{10}{3} $ \\
	      The three digits have $ 10 \times 10 \times 10 $ possible outcomes: $10^3$ \\
	      The remaining 7 characters each have 26 possible outcomes: $ 26^7 $ \\
	      $ |C| = \binom{10}{3} \times {10}^3 \times 26^7 $
\end{enumerate}
The total number of passwords is the sum of the passwords in sets $ A $, $ B $, or $ C $: \\
$ |A| + |B| + |C| $ \\
$ = \binom{10}{1} \times 10 \times 26^9 + \binom{10}{2} \times 10^2 \times 26^8 + \binom{10}{3} \times 10^3 \times 26^7 $

\subsection{Question 3}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} What is $ \sum_{k=0}^{45} \binom{45}{k} {(-3)}^{2k}$. \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Newton's Binomial Theorem (3.6.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's break it down \\
$ \sum_{k=0}^{45} \binom{45}{k} {{(-3)}^2}^{k} $ \\
$ \sum_{k=0}^{45} \binom{45}{k} {9}^{k} $ \\
$ \sum_{k=0}^{45} \binom{45}{k} {9}^{k} {1}^{45-k}$ \\
$ {(1+9)}^{45} $ \\
$ {10}^{45} $

\subsection{Question 4}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a group of 8 people, consisting of Simon, John, and 6 other people. \\
How many ways are there to arrange these 8 people on a horizontal line such that Simon and John are standing next to each other? \\
(The order on the line matters and Simon is either to the left or to the right of John.)
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Product Rule (3.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Since we want to keep Simon and John together, we can treat them as a single entity. \\
This reduces the problem to arranging 7 entities (Simon and John as one entity and the other 6 people) on a line. \\
There are 2 possible combinations with Simon on the left and John on the right, or Simon on the right and John on the left \\
The first entity (Simon and John) has 7 possible positions to choose from \\
The second entity has 6 possible positions to choose from \\
The third entity has 5 possible positions to choose from \\
\ldots \\
The seventh entity has 1 possible position to choose from \\
The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people is $ 2 \times 7 \cdot 6! $

\subsection{Question 5}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings consisting of $n$ characters, each character being $a, b$, or $c$. \\
Let $S_n$ be the number of such strings of length $n$ that do not contain the substring $aa$. \\
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } A Recursively Defined Set (4.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's consider all possible recursive cases for the strings of length $n$. \\
$b, S_{n-1}$ \\
$c, S_{n-1}$ \\
$a, b, S_{n-2}$ \\
$a, c, S_{n-2}$ \\
Adding it up, we get $S_n = S_{n-1} + S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} + S_{n-2} = 2S_{n-1} + 2S_{n-2}$ \\
Because the question asks for the case of $n+1$, we can substitute $n+1$ into the equation \\
$S_{n+1} = 2S_{n} + 2S_{n-1}$

\subsection{Question 6}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} In a group of 150 people,
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 30 weigh at least 150 pounds,
	\item 60 are at least 6 feet tall,
	\item 70 weigh less than 150 pounds and are less than 6 feet tall.
\end{enumerate}
How many people weigh at least 150 pounds and are at least 6 feet tall? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5), De Morgan's Law (no corresponding chapter) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's break it down \\
Let S = All people \\
Let A = Weigh at least 150 pounds \\
Let B = At least 6 feet tall \\
$ |S| = 150 $ \\
$ |A| = 30 $ \\
$ |B| = 60 $ \\
$ |\overline{A \cap B}| = 70 $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = S - |\overline{A \cup B}| = 150 - 70 = 80 $ \\
$ | A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $ \\
$ 80 = 30 + 60 - |A \cap B| $ \\
$ 80 - 30 - 60 = -|A \cap B| $ \\
$ -10 = -|A \cap B| $ \\
$ |A \cap B| = 10 $

\subsection{Question 7}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider 4 blue balls $B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4$ and 5 red balls $R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4, R_5$. \\
We pick 3 balls of the same color and arrange them on a horizontal line. (The order on the line matters.) \\
How many arrangements are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Product Rule (3.1), Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Sum Rule (3.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's break it down
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A = 3 blue balls \\
	      We choose 3 of the 4 blue balls $ \binom{4}{3} $ \\
	      The first red ball has 3 possible positions, second has 2 possible remaining positions, and the third has 1 remaining possible position: $ 3! $ \\
	      $ |A| = \binom{4}{3} \times 3! $ \\
	      $ |A| = 4 \times 3! $ \\
	      $ |A| = 24 $
	\item Let B = 3 red balls \\
	      We choose 3 of the 5 red balls: $ \binom{5}{3} $ \\
	      The first blue ball has 3 possible positions, second has 2 possible remaining positions, and the third has 1 remaining possible position: $ 3! $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{5}{3} \times 3! $ \\
	      $ |B| = 10 \times 3! $ \\
	      $ |B| = 60 $
\end{enumerate}
The total number of arrangements is the sum of the arrangements in sets $ A \cup B $: \\
$ |A| + |B| $ \\
$ = 24 + 60 $ \\
$ = 84 $

\subsection{Question 8}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a group of $n$ people, let $k$ be an integer with $1 \leq k \leq n$, and consider a circular table with $k$ chairs around it. \\
We select $k$ people and seat them around this table. \\
How many different seating arrangements are there? \\
(Two seating arrangements $A$ and $B$ are the same if for each person, the clockwise neighbor in $A$ is the same as the clockwise neighbor in $B$, and the counterclockwise neighbor in $A$ is the same as the counterclockwise neighbor in $B$.) \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Product Rule (3.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We need to determine the number of different seating arrangements.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We choose $ k $ people from $ n $ people: $ \binom{n}{k} $
	\item We also need to find the number of circular arrangements/permutations \\
	      It's important to identify that in a table of 3 people, $ (1,2,3), (2,3,1), and (3,1,2) $ are the same arrangement because 2 always has 1 on their left and 3 on their right \\
	      Therefore, we need to divide the number of linear arrangements by $ k $ to account for the rotations \\
	      $ (k-1)! $
\end{enumerate}
$ \binom{n}{k} \cdot (k-1)! $ \\
$ \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \cdot (k-1)! $ \\
$ \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \cdot \frac{(k-1)!}{1} $ \\
$ \frac{n!}{k(k-1)!(n-k)!} \cdot \frac{(k-1)!}{1} $ \\
$ \frac{n!}{k(n-k)!} $

\subsection{Question 9}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} How many solutions are there to the equation $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 777$, \\
where $x_1 \geq 0, x_2 \geq 0, x_3 \geq 0, x_4 \geq 0$ are integers? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Solutions of Linear Equations (3.9.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. \\
Imagine the first block composes $ x_1 $ stars, the second block composes $ x_2 $ stars, and so on. \\
We need to insert 3 bars to separate the 4 blocks. \\
Because we're inserting 3 bars, we add 3 extra positions \\
Now, stars to the left of the first bar represent $ x_1 $, stars between the first and second bars represent $ x_2 $, and so on. \\
The total number of positions is $ 777 + 3 = 780 $ \\
Now we choose 3 positions out of 780 to place the bars \\
The number of solutions is $ \binom{780}{3} $

\subsection{Question 10}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider the following recursive function:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $f(0) = 3$,
	\item $f(n+1) = f(n) + 10n + 2 \text{ for all integers } n \geq 0$.
\end{enumerate}
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Recursive Functions (4.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Calculate $ f(1) $ \\
$ f(1) = f(0) + 10(0) + 2 $ \\
$ f(1) = 3 + 0 + 2 $ \\
$ f(1) = 5 $
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ f(n) = 5n^{2} - 3n + 2 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 5{(1)}^2 - 3(1) + 2 = 5 - 3 + 2 = 4 $
	\item $ f(n) = 5n^{2} - 3n + 3 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 5{(1)}^2 - 3(1) + 3 = 5 - 3 + 3 = 5 $
	\item $ f(n) = 5n^{2} + 3n + 3 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 5{(1)}^2 + 3(1) + 3 = 5 + 3 + 3 = 11 $
	\item $ f(n) = 5n^{2} - 2n + 3 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 5{(1)}^2 - 2(1) + 3 = 5 - 2 + 3 = 6 $
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 11}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} The Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows: $f_0 = 0, f_1 = 1$, and $f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$ for $n \geq 2$. \\
Consider the recursive algorithm $ FIB $, which takes as input an integer $n \geq 0$. \\
For $n \geq 5$, run algorithm $FIB(n)$ and let $a_n$ be the number of times that $FIB(4)$ is called. \\
procedure Fib $ (n) $
if n = 0 or n = 1 then
f=n
else
f = Fib$ (n-1) $ + Fib$ (n-2) $
end if
return f
end procedure
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Fibonacci Numbers (4.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\subsection*{Step-by-Step Solution}

1. **Base Case Analysis:**
For $ n = 0 $ or $ n = 1 $, $ FIB(n) $ is called directly and returns $ n $.
For $ n \geq 2 $, the algorithm makes recursive calls to $ FIB(n-1) $ and $ FIB(n-2) $.

2. **Recursive Call Analysis:**
To find the number of times $ FIB(4) $ is called in $ FIB(n) $, we analyze the recursive structure of $ FIB $.
Each call to $ FIB(n) $ results in calls to $ FIB(n-1) $ and $ FIB(n-2) $.

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
Consider $ FIB(n) $ for different values of $ n $:
$ FIB(5) $ calls $ FIB(4) $ and $ FIB(3) $.
$ FIB(6) $ calls $ FIB(5) $ and $ FIB(4) $.
$ FIB(7) $ calls $ FIB(6) $ and $ FIB(5) $.

4. **Recursive Counting:**
Let $ a_n $ be the number of times $ FIB(4) $ is called in $ FIB(n) $.
Observe that $ a_n $ satisfies the recurrence relation similar to the Fibonacci sequence:
\[
	a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}
\]
Initial conditions are crucial:
$ FIB(4) $ is called 1 time in $ FIB(4) $.
$ FIB(5) $ calls $ FIB(4) $ directly once and $ FIB(3) $, which does not call $ FIB(4) $.

5. **Connecting to Fibonacci Sequence:**
The recurrence relation $ a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} $ with initial conditions $ a_4 = 1 $ and $ a_5 = 1 $ corresponds to the Fibonacci sequence shifted by 3:
\[
	a_n = f_{n-3}
\]

6. **Conclusion:**
Therefore, the number of times $ FIB(4) $ is called in $ FIB(n) $ is given by the Fibonacci number $ f_{n-3} $:
\[
	a_n = f_{n-3}
\]

\subsection{Question 12}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We choose a subset of ${1, 2, 3, 4, 5}$ uniformly at random. What is the probability that this subset has size 3?
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Bijection Rule (3.2.1), Basic Rules of Probability (5.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
The total number of subsets of a set with 5 elements is $2^5 = 32$. \\
The number of ways to choose a subset of size 3 from a set of 5 elements is $\binom{5}{3} = 10$. \\
The probability of choosing a subset of size 3 is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes: \\
$P(\text{subset of size 3}) = \frac{10}{32} = \frac{5}{16}$

\subsection{Question 13}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $A = {1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100}$. Let $x, y$, and $z$ be elements in $A$ that are chosen independently and uniformly at random. \\
What is the probability that $x = y = z$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Birthday Paradox (5.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$x$ can be any of the 100 elements in $A$: 100 \\
For $y$ to be equal to $x$, there is only 1 favorable outcome out of 100: 1 \\
Similarly, for $z$ to be equal to $x$, there is only 1 favorable outcome out of 100: 1 \\
The probability that $x = y = z$ is the product of the probabilities of each event: \\
$P(x = y = z) = \frac{100}{100} \times \frac{1}{100} = \frac{1}{100}$ \\
$P(x = y = z) = \frac{1}{100 \cdot 100}$

\subsection{Question 14}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We flip a fair coin repeatedly and independently, resulting in a sequence of heads $(H)$ and tails $(T)$. \\
We stop flipping the coin as soon as this sequence contains $H$ or $TTTT$. \\
What is the probability that this sequence contains at most two $T$s? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Basic Rules of Probability (5.3), The Sum Rule (3.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $A$ be the event that the sequence contains no $T$. \\
	      The set of outcomes for $A$ is $(H)$. \\
	      The probability of $A$ is $ \Pr(A) = \frac{1}{2}$ since the coin has a 50\% chance of landing heads.
	\item Let $B$ be the event that the sequence contains exactly one $T$. \\
	      The set of outcomes for $B$ is $(HT)$. \\
	      The coin has a 50\% chance of landing heads followed by 50\% chance of landing tails. \\
	      The probability of $B$ is $ \Pr(B) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}$
	\item Let $C$ be the event that the sequence contains exactly two $T$s. \\
	      The set of outcomes for $C$ is $(HTT)$. \\
	      the coin has a 50\% chance of landing heads followed by two 50\% chances of landing tails. \\
	      The probability of $C$ is $ \Pr(C) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}$
\end{enumerate}
The probability that the sequence contains at most two $T$s is the sum of the probabilities of events $A$, $B$, and $C$: \\
$(\Pr(\text{at most 2} T)) $
$ = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) + \Pr(C) $
$ = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}$

\subsection{Question 15}

\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Conditional Probability (5.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all outcomes when rolling two dice. \\
	      The size of S is the number of outcomes when rolling two dice: $ |S| = 6 \times 6 = 36 $
	\item Let's find the size of the set of outcomes for event $A$. \\
	      The set of A is $ \{ (3,1), (3,2), (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), (3,6), (1,3), (2,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3) \} $ \\
	      $ |A| = 11 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A)= \frac{|A|}{|S|} = \frac{11}{36} $
	\item Let's find the size of the set of outcomes for event $B$. \\
	      The set of B is $ \{ (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1) \} $ \\
	      $ |B| = 4 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B)= \frac{|B|}{|S|} = \frac{4}{36} = \frac{1}{9} $
	\item Let's find the size of the set of outcomes for event $ A \cap B $. \\
	      The set of $ A \cap B $ is $ \{ (3,2), (2,3) \} $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 2 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|S|} = \frac{2}{36} = \frac{1}{18} $
\end{enumerate}
Let's check whether the solution is correct \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\frac{1}{18}}{\frac{1}{9}} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{1}{18} \times \frac{9}{1} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{1}{2} $

\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $C_1$ be a fair coin that has $H$ on one side and $T$ on the other side.
Let $C_2$ be a coin that has $H$ on both sides. We choose one of $C_1$ and $C_2$ uniformly at random and flip it. Define the events
$A = $ \enquote{we choose $C_2$},
$B = $ \enquote{the flip resulted in $H$}.
What is the conditional probability $\Pr(A|B)$? \\ Conditional Probability
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Conditional Probability (5.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all outcomes in terms of coin chosen and face flipped. \\
	      The set of S is $ \{ (C_1, H), (C_1, T), (C_2, H), (C_2, H) \} $ \\
	      The size of S is the number of outcomes: $ |S| = 4 $
	\item Let's find the probability of A \\
	      The set of A is $ \{ (C_2, H), (C_2, H) \} $ \\
	      The size of A is the number of outcomes in $A$: $ |A| = 2 $ \\

	\item Let's find the probability of B \\
	      The set of B is $ \{ (C_1, H), (C_2, H), (C_2, H) \} $ \\
	      The size of B is the number of outcomes in $B$: $ |B| = 3 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{|B|}{|S|} = \frac{3}{4} $
	\item Let's find the probability of $A \cap B$ \\
	      The set of $A \cap B$ is $ \{ (C_2, H), (C_2, H) \} $ \\
	      The size of $A \cap B$ is the number of outcomes in $A \cap B$: $ |A \cap B| = 2 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|S|} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{3}{4}} $ \\

What is $\Pr(B|A)$? Conditional Probability
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Independent Events (5.11), Conditional Probability (5.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\subsection*{Step-by-Step Solution}
1. **Find $ \Pr(A \cap B) $:** \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\Pr(B \cap A)}{\Pr(B)} $ \\
$ \frac{2}{5} = \frac{\Pr(B \cap A)}{\frac{1}{2}} $ \\
$ \Pr(B \cap A) = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{5} $

2. **Find $ \Pr(B|A) $:** \\
$ \Pr(B|A) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(A)} $ \\

Each person in this group was born in a uniformly random month (from the 12 months of the year), independent of the other people's month of birth. \\
What is the probability that at least 2 of these 5 people were born in the same month? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Product Rule (3.1), The Complement Rules (3.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all possible outcomes when assigning a month of birth to each person. \\
	      Each person can be born in any of the 12 months: $  12^5 $ \\
	      $ |S| = {12}^5 $
	\item  Let A be the event that no people were born in the same month. \\
	      The first person can be born in any of the 12 months. \\

	      The third person can be born in any of the 10 remaining months. \\
	      The fourth person can be born in any of the 9 remaining months. \\
	      The fifth person can be born in any of the 8 remaining months. \\
	      $ |A| = 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 = \frac{11!}{7!}$ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} = \frac{11!}{7! \cdot 12^5} $

Thus, if both coins come up heads, you win \$3 \\
Define the random variable $X$ to be the amount of dollars that you win. What is the expected value of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Basic Rules of Probability (5.3), Expected Values (6.4) \\

	\item Let B be the event that the second coin comes up heads and you win \$2. \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{1}{2} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 1 \cdot \Pr(A) + 2 \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\

$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{3}{2} $

\subsection{Question 21}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} When a couple has a child, this child is a boy with probability $1/2$ and a girl with probability $1/2$, independent of the gender of previous children. \\
A couple stops having children as soon as they have 2 girls or 2 boys. Define the random variables
$G = $ the number of girls the couple has,
$B = $ the number of boys the couple has.
Are $G$ and $B$ independent random variables?
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Independent Events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Oh, we just need to find out something like $ \Pr(G = 1, B = 1) = \Pr(G = 1) \cdot \Pr(B = 1) $
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all subsets \\
	      $ S = \{ (BB), (GG), (BGB), (BGG), (GBG), (GBB) \} $ \\
	      $ |S| = 6 $
	\item Let's determine $ G = 1 $ \\
	      $ (G=1) = \{ (BGB), (GBB) \} $ \\
	      $ |G=1| = 2 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(G=1) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} $
	\item Let's determine $ B = 1 $ \\
	      $ (B=1) = \{ (BGB), (GBG) \} $ \\
	      $ |B=1| = 2 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B=1) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} $
	\item Let's determine $ G = 1, B = 1 $ \\
	      There is never a case where there is only 1 boy and 1 girl. We need them to pop out another baby to break the gender tie \\
	      $ G=1 \cap B=1 = \emptyset $ \\
	      $ \Pr(G=1, B=1) = 0 $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's check for independence \\
$ Pr(G=1 \cap B=1) = Pr(G=1) \cdot Pr(B=1) $ \\
$ 0 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} $ \\
$ 0 = \frac{1}{9} $ \\
$ 0 \neq \frac{1}{9} $ \\
Therefore, $ G $ and $ B $ are not independent random variables.

\subsection{Question 22}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} I flip a fair coin, independently, 10 times, resulting in a sequence of heads $ (H) $ and tails $ (T) $.
For each $HT$ in this sequence, you win \$3.
Define the random variable $X$ to be the amount of dollars that you win. For example, if the sequence is
$HHTTHTTHTT$, then $X = 9$. What is the expected value of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Indicator Random Variables (6.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if the current coin flip and the next coin flip are $HT$, and 0 otherwise. \\
$ \sum_{i=1}^{9} 3 X_i $ \\
The probability of getting HT is $ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} $ \\
Since we are determining the current coin flip and the next coin flip, we do not measure the final coin flip and a non-existant next coin flip. \\
Because we flip the coin 10 times, we can get 9 HTs. \\
$ 27 \cdot \frac{1}{4} $ \\
$ \frac{27}{4} $

What is the expected value of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\

	      The size of S is the number of outcomes when rolling a pair of dice: $ |S| = 6 \times 6 = 36 $
	\item Let A be the set of all pairs of dice rolls that sum to 7. \\
	      The set of A is $ \{ (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) \} $ \\
	      The size of A is the number of outcomes in $A$: $ |A| = 6 $
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6} $
\end{enumerate}
The Geometric Distribution is used to model the number of trials needed to achieve the first success in repeated independent Bernoulli trials. \\
The expected value of a Geometric Distribution with probability of success $ p $ is given by $ \frac{1}{p} $. \\
Therefore, the expected value of $ X $ is $ \frac{1}{\frac{1}{6}} = 6 $.

\subsection{Question 24}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We flip a fair coin independently $n$ times. Define the random variable \\
$X = $ the number of heads minus the number of tails in the sequence of $n$ flips. \\
What is the expected value of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Linearity of Expectations (6.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$ X = H - T $
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $E(H) = n \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{n}{2}$
	\item $E(T) = n \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{n}{2}$
\end{enumerate}
We may use Linearity of Expectations on $E(X)$ \\
$E(X) = E(H) - E(T) = \frac{n}{2} - \frac{n}{2} = 0$









\section{2015 Fall Final}
\subsection{Question 1}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a set $S$ consisting of 20 integers; 5 of these are strictly positive and the other 15 integers in $S$ are strictly negative. \\
What is the number of 3-element subsets of $S$ having the property that the product of the 3 elements in the subset is negative? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Sum Rule (3.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
There are 2 cases to consider:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A be the event that the subset contains 3 negative integers. \\
	      We choose 3 of the 15 negative integers: $ \binom{15}{3} $ \\
	      $ |A| = \binom{15}{3} $
	\item Let B be the event that the subset contains 1 negative integer and 2 positive integers. \\
	      We choose 1 of the 15 negative integers: $ \binom{15}{1} = 15 $ \\
	      We choose 2 of the 5 positive integers: $ \binom{5}{2} $ \\
	      $ |B| = 15 \times \binom{5}{2} $
\end{enumerate}
The total number of 3-element subsets of $S$ having the property that the product of the 3 elements in the subset is negative is the sum of the subsets in sets $ A \cup B $: \\
$ |A| + |B| $ \\
$ = \binom{15}{3} + 15 \times \binom{5}{2} $

\subsection{Question 2}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a set $S$ consisting of 20 integers. \\
The integer 0 is an element of $S$, 9 elements in $S$ are strictly positive, and the remaining 10 elements are strictly negative. \\
What is the number of 7-element subsets of $S$ having the property that the product of the 7 elements in the subset is equal to 0? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: }  The Product Rule(3.1), Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Since the product of the 7 elements in the subset is 0, the subset must contain 0 once: 1 \\
From here, it doesn't matter which numbers we choose since multiplying values by 0 will result in 0: $ \binom{19}{6} $

\subsection{Question 3}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} How many bitstrings $s_1s_2 \ldots s_{20}$ of length 20 have the property that $s_1s_2s_3 = 100$ or $s_2s_3s_4 = 000$?
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A be the event that $s_1s_2s_3 = 100$. \\
	      The first 3 bits are fixed: 1 0 0. \\
	      The remaining 17 bits can be any combination of 0s and 1s: $2^{17}$. \\
	      $ |A| = 2^{17} $
	\item Let B be the event that $s_2s_3s_4 = 000$. \\
	      The bits are fixed: 0 0 0. \\
	      The remaining 17 bits can be any combination of 0s and 1s: $2^{17}$. \\
	      $ |B| = 2^{17} $
	\item Let $A \cap B$ be the event that $s_1 s_2 s_3 s_4= 10000$ \\
	      The bits are fixed: 1 0 0 0. \\
	      The remaining 16 bits can be any combination of 0s and 1s: $2^{16}$. \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 2^{16} $
\end{enumerate}
$ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = 2^{17} + 2^{17} - 2^{16} $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = (1+1) \cdot 2^{17} - 2^{16} $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = 2 \cdot 2^{17} - 2^{16} $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = 2^{18} - 2^{16} $

\subsection{Question 4}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} What is the coefficient of $x^{15}y^{5}$ in the expansion of ${(-3x + 5y)}^{20}$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Newton’s Binomial Theorem (3.6.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$ = \sum^{20}_{k=0} \binom{20}{k} {(-3x)}^{k} {(5y)}^{20-k} $ \\
$ = \binom{20}{15} {(-3)}^{15} {5}^{5} x^{15} y^5 $ \\
$ = - \binom{20}{15} {(3)}^{15} {5}^{5} x^{15} y^5 $ \\
Thus, the coefficient of $x^{15}y^{5}$ in the expansion of ${(-3x + 5y)}^{20}$ is $ - \binom{20}{15} {(3)}^{15} {5}^{5} $

\subsection{Question 5}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} In a group of 30 people,

10 are blond,
20 have green eyes,
9 are not blond and do not have green eyes.

How many people in this group are blond and have green eyes?
\textbf{Correct Answer: }  B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5), De Morgan's Law (no corresponding chapter) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all people in the group. \\
	      The size of S is the number of people in the group: $ |S| = 30 $
	\item Let A be the event that a person is blond. \\
	      $ |A| = 10 $
	\item Let B be the event that a person has green eyes. \\
	      $ |B| = 20 $
	\item Let $ \overline{A \cup B} $ be the event that a person is not blond and does not have green eyes. \\
	      $ |\overline{A \cap B}| = 9 $ \\
	      $ |A \cup B| = |S| - |\overline{A \cap B}| $ \\
	      $ |A \cup B| = 30 - 9 $ \\
	      $ |A \cup B| = 21 $
	\item Let $A \cap B$ be the event that a person is blond and has green eyes. \\
	      $ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $ \\
	      $ 21 = 10 + 20 - |A \cap B| $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 10 + 20 - 21 $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 9 $
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 6}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings of characters, each character being $a, b$, or $c$, that contain at least one $a$. \\
Let $S_n$ be the number of such strings having length $n$. Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), The Complement Rule (3.3)\\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We're basically looking for the total number of strings of length $n$ excluding those that have no $a$s.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all strings \\
	      The first character can be any of the 3 characters: 3 \\
	      The second character can be any of the 3 characters: 3 \\
	      \ldots \\
	      The $n$th character can be any of the 3 characters: 3 \\
	      $ |S| = 3^n $
	\item Let A be the event that a string has no $a$s. \\
	      The first character can be any of the 2 characters: 2 \\
	      The second character can be any of the 2 characters: 2 \\
	      \ldots \\
	      The $n$th character can be any of the 2 characters: 2 \\
	      $ |A| = 2^n $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's exclude the strings that contain no a's \\
$ |S| - |A| = 3^n - 2^n $

\subsection{Question 7}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings of characters, each character being $a, b$, or $c$, that contain at least one $a$. \\
Let $S_n$ be the number of such strings having length $n$. Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } A Reursively Definsed Set (4.3), Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's write out the possibilities I guess
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ b, S_(n-1) $
	\item $ c, S_(n-1) $
	\item $ a, 3^{n-1} $ because we could have our first $a$ here, and the rest of the string can be any of the 3 characters
\end{enumerate}
$ S_n = 2 \cdot S_{n-1} + 3^{n-1} $

\subsection{Question 8}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider the following recursive function:
$f(0) = 7$,
$f(n) = 2 \cdot f(n-1) + 1$ for all integers $n \geq 1$.
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Recursive Functions (4.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Calculate $ f(1) $
$ f(1) = 2 \cdot f(0) + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15 $
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ f(n) = 8n + 7 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 8 \cdot 1 + 7 = 15 $
	\item $ f(n) = 4n^{2} + 4n + 7 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 4 \cdot 1^{2} + 4 \cdot 1 + 7 = 15 $
	\item $ f(n) = 2^{n+3} - 1$ \\
	      $ f(1) = 2^{1+3} - 1 = 15 $
	\item None of the above
\end{enumerate}
$ f(n) = 2^{n+3} - 1$ is true.

\subsection{Question 9}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider the following recursive algorithm $ FIB $, which takes as input an integer $n \geq 0$. \\
If we run algorithm $FIB(18)$, how many calls are there to $FIB(14)$? \\
procedure FIB$(n)$ \\
if n = 0 or n = 1 then
f=n
else
$f = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2)$
end If
return f
end procedure
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Recursive Functions (4.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We can draw a recursive tree to visualize the number of calls to $FIB(14)$ when running $FIB(18)$. \\
\begin{forest}
	[Fib$ (18) $
		[Fib$ (17) $
				[Fib$ (16) $
						[Fib$ (15) $
								[Fib$ (14) $]
									[FIB$ (13) $]
							]
							[FIB$ (14) $]
					]
					[Fib$ (15) $
						[Fib$ (14) $]
							[FIB$ (13) $]
					]
			]
			[Fib$ (16) $
				[Fib$ (15) $
						[Fib$ (14) $]
							[FIB$ (13) $]
					]
					[FIB$ (14) $]
			]
	]
\end{forest} \\
There are 5 calls to $FIB(14)$ when running $FIB(18)$.

\subsection{Question 10}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} What is the number of bitstrings of length $n$ that contain 00 or 11? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), The Complement Rule (3.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all bitstrings of length $n$. \\
	      $ |S| = 2^{n} $
	\item Let A be the event that a string does not contain 00 or 11. \\
	      The strings are only $1010...10$ or $0101...01$. \\
	      $ |A| = 2 $
\end{enumerate}
Now, we exclude the strings that do not contain 00 or 11 \\
$ |S| - |A| = 2^{n} - 2 $

\subsection{Question 11}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Nick gets 75 bananas for his birthday. He decides to eat them all over a period of 5 days. \\
In order to do this, Nick makes a banana-schedule, which specifies the number of bananas he is going to eat on the first day, on the second day, etc., up to the fifth day. \\
For example, $(20, 20, 10, 20, 5), (40, 13, 0, 20, 2)$, and $(40, 13, 20, 2, 0)$ are three different banana-schedules. \\
What is the total number of banana-schedules? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Solutions of Linear Equations (3.9.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's use dividers to separate the bananas eaten per day. \\
We have 75 bananas and 4 dividers.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $x_1$ represents the number of bananas to the left of the first divider
	\item $x_2$ represents the number of bananas between the first and second dividers
	\item $x_3$ represents the number of bananas between the second and third dividers
	\item $x_4$ represents the number of bananas between the third and fourth dividers
	\item $x_5$ represents the number of bananas to the right of the fourth divider
\end{enumerate}
Since we have added positions for dividers to the 75 bananas, we have 79 positions in total. \\
We need to choose 4 positions for the dividers: $ \binom{79}{4} $

\subsection{Question 12}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A bowl contains 5 red balls and 7 blue balls. We choose a uniformly random subset of 3 balls. Define the event
$A = $ \enquote{exactly 2 of the chosen balls are red}.
What is $\Pr(A)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Product Rule (3.1), Uniform Probability Spaces (4.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
First, we choose 1 of the 7 blue balls: $ \binom{7}{1} = 7$ \\
Then, we choose 2 of the 5 red balls: $ \binom{5}{2} $ \\
The total number of ways to choose 3 balls from the 12 balls is $ \binom{12}{3} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{7 \cdot \binom{5}{2}}{\binom{12}{3}} $

\subsection{Question 13}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a uniformly random bitstring of length 5. Define the events
$A = $ \enquote{the first three bits are 101 or 110},
$B = $ \enquote{the last three bits are 111}.
Which of the following is true?
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all possible bitstrings of length 5. \\
	      The size of S is the number of bitstrings of length 5: $ |S| = 2^{5} = 32 $
	\item In the instance of A, the first 3 bits can be fixed as 101 or 110: 2 ways. \\
	      The last 2 bits can be any combination of 0s and 1s: $2^{2}$. \\
	      $ |A| = 2 \times 2^{2} = 8 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{8}{32} = \frac{1}{4} $
	\item In the instance of B, the first 2 bits can be any combination of 0s and 1s: $2^{2}$. \\
	      The last 3 bits are fixed as 111: 1 way. \\
	      $ |B| = 2^{2} = 4 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{4}{32} = \frac{1}{8} $
	\item Let $A \cap B$ be the event that the first 3 bits are 101 or 110 AND the last 3 bits are 111. \\
	      When the last 3 bits are 111, the first 3 bits cannot be 110 \\
	      This leaves us with 10111 as the only bitstring that satisfies both conditions. \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 1 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{32} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, we check whether they are independent or not \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{32} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{8} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{32} = \frac{1}{32} $ \\
The events A and B are independent.

\subsection{Question 14}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n$ be the number of students who are writing this exam. \\
Each of these students has a uniformly random birthday, which is independent of the birthdays of the other students. \\
We ignore leap years; thus, the year has 365 days. Define the event \\
$A = $ \enquote{at least one student's birthday is on December 21}.
What is $\Pr(A)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Birthday Paradox (5.5), The Complement Rule (3.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let B be the event that no student's birthday is on December 21. \\
The first student has a birthday on any day except December 21: $ \frac{364}{365} $ \\
The second student has a birthday on any day except December 21: $ \frac{364}{365} $ \\
\ldots \\
The $n$th student has a birthday on any day except December 21: $ \frac{364}{365} $ \\
$ \Pr(B) = {\left( \frac{364}{365} \right)}^{n} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = 1 - \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = 1 - {\left( \frac{364}{365} \right)}^{n} $

\subsection{Question 15}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:}
The course COMP 9999 runs over a period of one year, starting on January 1 and ending on December 31. \\
There is one lecture every day; thus, the total number of lectures is 365. \\
Dania and Nick take this course. Dania's birthday is on November 19. Nick's birthday is on December 3. \\
Professor G. Ruesome teaches the course. Professor Ruesome decides to have 20 quizzes during the year. \\
For this, he chooses a uniformly random subset of 20 days; the quizzes will be on the 20 chosen days. \\
(It is possible that there is a quiz on January 1.) \\
Determine $\Pr(A)$, where $A$ is the event \\
$A = $ \enquote{There is a quiz on Dania's birthday and there is a quiz on Nick's birthday}. \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), Uniform Probability Spaces (4.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's assume that the birthdays of Diana and Nick are chosen \\
That means we have 363 days left to choose 18 days for the quizzes: $ \binom{363}{18} $ \\
The total number of ways to choose 20 days for the quizzes is $ \binom{365}{20} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{\binom{363}{18}}{\binom{365}{20}} $

\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's determine C \\
	      We choose 5 of the 31 days in December: $ \binom{31}{5} $ \\
	      The remaining 15 quizzes can be on any of the 334 days in the year: $ \binom{334}{15} $ \\
	      $ |C| = \binom{31}{5} \cdot \binom{334}{15} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(C) = \frac{\binom{31}{5} \cdot \binom{334}{15}}{\binom{365}{20}} $
	\item Let's determine $ B \cap C $ \\
	      1 of the days in December is Nick's birthday, so that's fixed: 1 \\
	      We choose 4 of the remaining 30 days in December: $ \binom{30}{4} $ \\
	      The remaining 15 quizzes can be on any of the 334 days in the year: $ \binom{334}{15} $ \\
	      $ |B \cap C| = \binom{30}{4} \cdot \binom{334}{15} $ \\

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 17}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:}
The course COMP 9999 runs over a period of one year, starting on January 1 and ending on December 31.
There is one lecture every day; thus, the total number of lectures is 365.
At the beginning of each of the 365 lectures, Nick flips a fair and independent coin twice.
If the coin comes up heads twice, then Nick eats 3 bananas during the lecture; otherwise, Nick eats 5 bananas during the lecture.
Let $X$ be the total number of bananas that Nick eats during the 365 lectures of the course COMP 9999.
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Indicator Random Variables (6.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $Y_i$ be 1 if Nick gets 2 heads and 0 otherwise. \\
The chances of getting 2 heads is $ \frac{1}{4} $ \\
$E(Y_i=1) = frac{1}{4} $ \\
Let $Z_i$ be 1 if Nick does not get 2 heads and 0 otherwise. \\
The chances of getting 1 or 0 heads is $ \frac{3}{4} $ \\
$E(Z_i=1) = frac{3}{4} $ \\
$ X = \sum_{i=1}^{365} 3 \cdot E(Y_i) + \sum_{i=1}^{365} 5 \cdot E(Z_i) $ \\
$ X = 3 \cdot 365 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 5 \cdot 365 \cdot \frac{3}{4} $ \\
$ X = \frac{3 \cdot 365}{4} + \frac{5 \cdot 365 \cdot 3}{4} $ \\

$ X = \frac{3 \cdot 365 + 15 \cdot 365}{4} $ \\
$ X = \frac{ (3+15) \cdot 365}{4} $ \\
$ X = \frac{18 \cdot 365}{4} $ \\
$ X = \frac{9 \cdot 365}{2} $

\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Okay. This is a loaded question, so let's break it down
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's find the expected value of $Y$ \\
	      The first student has a $ \frac{1}{n} $ chance of receiving a gift of $v_1$ \\
	      The second student has a $ \frac{1}{n} $ chance of receiving a gift of $v_2$ \\
	      \ldots \\
	      The $n$th student has a $ \frac{1}{n} $ chance of receiving a gift of $v_n$ \\
	      $ \mathbb{E}(Y) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{v_i}{n} $ \\
	      $ \mathbb{E}(Y) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i $
	\item Let's find the expected value of $Z$ \\
	      The first student has a $ \frac{1}{n} $ chance of receiving a gift of $v_1$ \\
	      The second student has a $ \frac{1}{n} $ chance of receiving a gift of $v_2$ \\
	      \ldots \\
	      The $n$th student has a $ \frac{1}{n} $ chance of receiving a gift of $v_n$ \\
	      $ \mathbb{E}(Z) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{v_i}{n} $ \\
	      $ \mathbb{E}(Z) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i $
\end{enumerate}
$ \mathbb{E}(2 \cdot Y - Z) $ \\
$ = \mathbb{E}(2 \cdot Y) - \mathbb{E}(Z) $ \\
$ = 2 \cdot \mathbb{E}(Y) - \mathbb{E}(Z) $ \\
$ = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i $ \\
$ = \frac{2}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i $ \\
$ = \frac{2 - 1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i $ \\
$ = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i $ \\
$ =  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{v_i}{n} $

\subsection{Question 20}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You repeatedly, and independently, flip three fair coins, until there are exactly two heads among the three flips. Define the random variable $X$ to be the total number of coin flips. For example, if the coin flips result in
$(TTT), (THT), (HHH), (HTH)$,
then $X = 12$.
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$?
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Determining the Expected Value (6.6.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if the 3 coin flips result in exactly 2 heads and 0 otherwise. \\
The probability of getting exactly 2 heads is $ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{3}{8} $ \\
Since $X_i$ represents 3 coin flips, we need to divide by 3 to get the expected value of 1 coin flip. \\
$ E(X_i) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{8} $ \\
$ E(X_i) = \frac{1}{8} $ \\
Now, we use geometric distribution to find the expected value of $X$. \\
$ E(X) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{8}} = 8 $

\subsection{Question 21}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n$ be an integer with $n \geq 3$. \\
Consider a bitstring of length $n$, in which each bit is 0 with probability $1/3$ (and, thus, 1 with probability $2/3$), independently of the other bits. Let $X$ be the number of occurrences of 010 in this bitstring. \\
For example, if the bitstring is $0010100100$, then $X = 3$. \\
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$? \\
Hint: Use indicator random variables. \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Indicator Random Variables (6.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if the bitstring contains 010 and 0 otherwise. \\
Three is a 1 in 3 chance of a 0 followed by a 2 in 3 chance of a 1 followed by a 1 in 3 chance of a 0. \\
$ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} $ \\
$ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{2}{27} $ \\
When we are predicting the value of the current bit and the next 2 bits, there must be 2 bits after the current bit \\
As a result, the second last bit and last bit are not considered. \\
We consider the first $ n-2 $ bits of the bitstring. \\
$ E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-2} \frac{2}{27} $ \\
$ E(X) = (n-2) \cdot \frac{2}{27} $
$ E(X) = \frac{2(n-2)}{27} $

\subsection{Question 22}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $S = {1, 2, \ldots, n}$ and let $T$ be a set of $m$ unordered pairs of distinct elements of $S$. \\
Thus, $T \subseteq {{i,j}: 1 \leq i < j \leq n}$.\\
Consider a coin that comes up heads with probability $1/3$ and, thus, tails with probability $2/3$.\\
For each element of $S$, flip the coin, and \\
let $S$' be the set consisting of all elements of $S$ whose coin flip resulted in heads. \\
Let $T$' be the set consisting of all elements ${i,j}$ in $T$ for which both $i$ and $j$ are in $S$'. \\
Let $X$ be the size of the set $T$'. What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$? \\
Hint: Use indicator random variables.
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Indicator Random Variables (6.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if the pair ${i,j}$ is in $T$' and 0 otherwise. \\
The probability of $i$ and $j$ being in $S$' is $ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} $ \\
$ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{9} $ \\
There are $m$ pairs in $T$, and we are calculating the number of pairs in $T$'. \\
Since there are $m$ pairs, we sum it up $m$ times \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} 1 \cdot \Pr(X_i = 1) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} 1 \cdot \frac{1}{9} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{m}{9} $

\subsection{Question 23}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $S$ be a uniformly random 2-element subset of ${1, 2, 3, 4}$, and let $X$ be the number of elements of $S$ that are even.
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ S = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} $ \\
	      $ S = \{1, 2\}, \{1, 3\}, \{1, 4\}, \{2, 3\}, \{2, 4\}, \{3, 4\} $
	\item $ X = 0 $ if $ S = \{1, 3\} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=0) = \frac{1}{6} $
	\item $ X = 1 $ if $ S = \{1, 2\}, \{2, 3\}, \{1, 4\}, \{3, 4\} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=1) = \frac{4}{6} $
	\item $ X = 2 $ if $ S = \{2, 4\} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=2) = \frac{1}{6} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 0 \cdot \Pr(X=0) + 1 \cdot \Pr(X=1) + 2 \cdot \Pr(X=2) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 0 \cdot \frac{1}{6} + 1 \cdot \frac{4}{6} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{6} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 0 + \frac{4}{6} + \frac{2}{6} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{6}{6} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 1 $

\subsection{Question 24}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a coin that comes up heads with probability $1/3$ and, thus, tails with probability $2/3$.
Consider the following recursive algorithm $HEADS$, which takes as input a positive integer $k$.
You run algorithm $HEADS$, i.e., with $k = 1$.
Define the random variable $X$ to be the value of the output of this algorithm. Let $m \geq 1$ be an integer.
What is $\Pr(X = m+1)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$ \Pr(X=2) = \frac{1}{3} $, m=1 \\
$ \Pr(X=3) = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2^1}{2^2} $, m=2 \\
$ \Pr(X=4) = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2^2}{3^3} $, m=3 \\
The pattern is that $ \Pr(X=m) = \frac{2^{m-1}}{3^m} $

What is the number of 7-element subsets of $S$ having at least 5 even integers or at least 5 odd integers? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: }  Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Product Rule (3.1), The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let $A$ be the event that a 7-element subset of $S$ has 5 even integers and 2 odd integers. \\
	      First, we choose 5 of the 5 even integers: $ \binom{5}{5} $ \\
	      Then, we choose 2 of the 15 odd integers: $ \binom{15}{2} $ \\
	      $ |A| = \binom{5}{5} \cdot \binom{15}{2} $
	\item Let $B$ be the event that a 7-element subset of $S$ has 5 odd integers and 2 even integers. \\
	      First, we choose 5 of the 15 odd integers: $ \binom{15}{5} $ \\
	      Then, we choose 2 of the 5 even integers: $ \binom{5}{2} $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{15}{5} \cdot \binom{5}{2} $
	\item Let $C$ be the event that a 7-element subset of $S$ has 6 odd integers and 1 even integer. \\
	      First, we choose 6 of the 15 odd integers: $ \binom{15}{6} $ \\
	      Then, we choose 1 of the 5 even integers: $ \binom{5}{1} $ \\

	      First, we choose 7 of the 15 odd integers: $ \binom{15}{7} $ \\
	      $|D| = \binom{15}{7} $
\end{enumerate}
The total number of 7-element subsets of $S$ having at least 5 even integers or at least 5 odd integers is $ |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| $ \\
$ = \binom{5}{5} \binom{15}{2} + \binom{15}{5} \binom{5}{2} + \binom{15}{6} \binom{5}{1} + \binom{15}{7} $

\subsection{Question 3}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} How many bitstrings of length 77 start with 1111 or end with 0000? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let A be the event that a bitstring of length 77 starts with 1111. \\
The first 4 bits are fixed as 1111. \\
The remaining 73 bits can be any combination of 0s and 1s: $2^{73}$. \\
$ |A| = 2^{73} $ \\
Let B be the event that a bitstring of length 77 ends with 0000. \\
The last 4 bits are fixed as 0000. \\
The first 73 bits can be any combination of 0s and 1s: $2^{73}$. \\
$ |B| = 2^{73} $ \\
Let $ A \cap B $ be the event that a bitstring of length 77 starts with 1111 AND ends with 0000. \\
The first 4 bits are fixed as 1111. \\
The last 4 bits are fixed as 0000. \\
The remaining 69 bits can be any combination of 0s and 1s: $2^{69}$. \\
$ |A \cap B| = 2^{69} $ \\
The total number of bitstrings of length 77 that start with 1111 or end with 0000 is $ |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $ \\
$ = 2^{73} + 2^{73} - 2^{69} $ \\
$ = (1+1) 2^{73} - 2^{69} $ \\
$ = (2) 2^{73} - 2^{69} $ \\
$ = 2^{74} - 2^{69} $

\subsection{Question 4}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} What is the coefficient of $x^{4}y^{11}$ in the expansion of $ {(2x-7y)}^{15}$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Newton’s Binomial Theorem (3.6.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$ {(2x-7y)}^{15} = \sum_{k=4}^{15} \binom{15}{k} {(2x)}^{k} {(-7y)}^{15-k} $ \\
$ = \binom{15}{4} 2^{4} {(-7)}^{11} x^4 y^{11}$ \\

6 are blond,
7 have green eyes,
11 are not blond and do not have green eyes.

How many people in this group are blond and have green eyes? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5), De Morgan's Law (no corresponding chapter) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let B be the event that someone is blond \\
	      $ |B| = 6 $
	\item Let G be the event that someone has green eyes \\
	      $ |G| = 7 $
	\item Let $ \overline{B} \cap \overline{G} $ be the event that someone is not blond and not green-eyed
	      $ | \overline{B} \cap \overline{G} | = 11 $
\end{enumerate}
$ |B \cup G| = 20 - 11 = 9 $ \\
$ |B \cup G| = |B| + |G| - |B \cap G| $ \\
$ 9 = 6 + 7 - |B \cap G| $ \\
$ |B \cap G| = 4 $

\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Recursive Functions (4.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Calculate $ f(1) $ \\
$ f(1) = f(0) + 6 \cdot 1 - 3 = 7 + 6 - 3 = 10 $
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ f(n) = 2n^{2} + 7 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 2 \cdot 1^{2} + 7 = 2 + 7 = 9 $
	\item $ f(n) = 3n^{2} + 7 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 3 \cdot 1^{2} + 7 = 3 + 7 = 10 $
	\item $ f(n) = 4n^{2} + 7 $ \\
	      $ f(1) = 4 \cdot 1^{2} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 $

if n=0 or n=1 then
f = n
else
f = Fib$(n-1)$ + Fib$(n-2)$
end if
return f
end procedure
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Recursive Functions (4.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's draw a recursive tree to find out how many calls there are to $FIB(73)$ when we run $FIB(77)$. \\
\begin{forest}
	[FIB$ (77) $
		[FIB$ (76) $
				[FIB$ (75) $

If $(a,b) \in S$ then $(a+5, b+2) \in S$.

Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
The sum of 1 and 6 is divisible by 7. \\
Upon adding 3 and 4 to the total sum, it adds 7. This means it's still divisible by 7. \\
Upon adding 5 and 2 to the total sum, it adds 7. This means it's still divisible by 7. \\
As a result, every element (a,b) in S, a+b is divisible by 7

\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Solutions of Linear Equations (3.9.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. \\
We have 3 dividers and 99 stars.
\begin{enumerate}

\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Conditional Probability (5.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)} $ \\
$ \frac{4}{5} = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\frac{2}{3}} $ \\

\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$ \Pr(A \cup (\overline{B} \cap \overline{C})) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) - \Pr(C) $.
I would honestly need to draw it out to prove it's false

\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Complement Rule (3.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let S be the set of all possible 20-element subsets of S. \\
We simply choose 20 elements from the 100 elements in $S$: $ \binom{100}{20} $ \\
$ |S| = \binom{100}{20} $ \\
Let B be the event that none of the elements in the subset is positive. \\
The number of ways to choose 20 negative elements from the 70 negative elements in $S$: $ \binom{70}{20} $ \\
$ |B| = \binom{70}{20} $ \\
$ \Pr(B) = \frac{\binom{70}{20}}{\binom{100}{20}} $ \\
Let A be the event that at least one of the elements in the subset is positive. \\
$ \Pr(A) = 1 - \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = 1 - \frac{\binom{70}{20}}{\binom{100}{20}} $

We choose, uniformly at random, a 20-element subset of $S$. \\
Let $x$ be the product of the integers in the chosen subset. \\
What is the probability that $x > 0$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Sum Rule (3.4), Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Rephrased, it's asking \text{What are the chances that the product is positive?} \\
The product is positive if there are an even number of negative integers in the subset. \\
0 negatives and 30 positives: $ \binom{70}{0} \binom{30}{20} $ \\
2 negatives and 28 positives: $ \binom{70}{2} \binom{30}{18} $ \\
4 negatives and 26 positives: $ \binom{70}{4} \binom{30}{16} $ \\
The pattern is $ \sum_{i=0}^{10} \binom{70}{2i} \binom{30}{20-2i} $ \\
To get the probability, we need to divide by $ \binom{100}{20} $ for each case \\
Thus, the final answer is $ \binom{100}{20} \sum_{i=0}^{10} \binom{70}{2i} \binom{30}{20-2i} $

\subsection{Question 16}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a bitstring of length 77, in which each bit is 0 with probability $1/3$ (and, thus, 1 with probability $2/3$), independently of the other bits. What is the probability that there are exactly 15 0s in this bitstring? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Determining the Expected Value (6.7.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X$ be the number of 0s in this bitstring. \\
$X \sim \text{Binomial}(77, 1/3)$ \\
$ \Pr(X=15) = \binom{77}{15} {\left( \frac{1}{3} \right)}^{15} {\left( \frac{2}{3} \right)}^{77-15} $

\subsection{Question 17}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a uniformly random bitstring of length 5. Define the events
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $A = \text{the bitstring contains exactly two 0s} $,
	\item $B = \text{the bitstring contains an even number of 0s} $.
\end{enumerate}
(Note that zero is even.) What is the conditional probability $\Pr(A|B)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Conditional Probability (5.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's determine B \\
	      $ |B| = 2^4 $
	\item Let's determine $ A = A \cap B $
	      $ |A| = \binom{5}{2} $
	\item $ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\binom{5}{2}}{2^4} $
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 18}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a uniformly random bitstring of length 5. Define the events \\
$A = \text{the bitstring contains an odd number of 0s} $, \\
$B = \text{the first three bits in the bitstring are 111} $. \\
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), Independent Events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all bitstrings of length 5. \\
	      $ |S| = 2^5 $
	\item A occurs when there are 1, 3, or 5 0s in the bitstring. \\
	      $ |A| = \binom{5}{1} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{5} $ \\
	      $ |A| = 5 + 10 + 1 $ \\
	      $ |A| = 16 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{\binom{5}{1} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{5}}{2^5} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{16}{2^5} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{2^4}{2^5} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item B occurs when the first 3 bits are 111. \\
	      This leaves the remaining 2 bits free to be any combination of 0s and 1s: $2^2$ \\
	      $ |B| = 2^2 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{2^2}{2^5} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{1}{2^3} $
	\item $ A \cap B $ occurs when the first 3 bits are 111 and there is 1 0
	      The 0 can be at either position 4 or 5: 2 \\
	      The other bit is forced to be a 1: 1 \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 2 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{2}{2^5} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{2^4} $
\end{enumerate}
If they are independent, the probability of both events occurring is the product of the probabilities of each event occurring. \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{2^4} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2^3} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{2^4} = \frac{1}{2^4} $ \\
$ 1 = 1 $ \\
Since the equation is true, A and B are independent.

\subsection{Question 19}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} I flip a fair coin, independently, $n$ times. For each heads, you win \$3, whereas for each tails, you lose \$1. \\
Define the random variable $X$ to be the amount of dollars that you win. What is the expected value of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Basic Rules of Probability (5.3), Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A be the event that you win \$3 by flipping a tails \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item Let B be the event that you lose \$1 by flipping a heads \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{1}{2} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 3 \cdot \Pr(A) - 1 \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + (-1) \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = ( \frac{3}{2} - \frac{1}{2} )n $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{2}{2} n $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = n $

\subsection{Question 20}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $G = (V,E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$, let $n$ be the size of $V$, and let $m$ be the size of $E$. \\
For each vertex of $V$, flip a fair and independent coin. \\
Let $V$' be the subset of $V$ consisting of all vertices of $V$ whose coin flip resulted in heads. \\
Let $E$' be the set consisting of all edges $(u,v)$ in $E$ for which both $u$ and $v$ are in $V$'. \\
Define the random variable $X$ to be the number of edges in $E$'. What is the expected value of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Indicator Random Variables (6.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if the $i$th edge is in $E'$ and 0 otherwise. \\
For an edge to be in $E'$, both of its vertices must be in $V'$ \\
$ \Pr(X_i=1) = \frac{1}{4} $ \\
Now, we need to check how many edges in $E$ are in $E'$ based on the vertices in $V'$ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \mathbb{E}(X_i) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \Pr(X_i=1) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \frac{1}{4} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{m}{4} $

\subsection{Question 21}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a bitstring of length 5, in which each bit is 0 with probability $1/2$ (and, thus, 1 with probability $1/2$), independently of the other bits. Define the random variables $X$ and $Y$ as follows:
$X = $ the number of 0s in this bitstring
and
$Y = $ the value of the first bit in this bitstring.
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), Independent Events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's just check some $ \Pr(X=x \cap Y=y) = \Pr(X=x) \cdot \Pr(Y=y) $
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all bitstrings of length 5. \\
	      $ |S| = 2^5 $
	\item Let's find $ X = 5 $ \\
	      The first bit is 0: 1 \\
	      The second bit is 0: 1 \\
	      \ldots \\
	      The fifth bit is 0: 1 \\
	      $ |X=5| = 1 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=5) = \frac{1}{2^5} $
	\item Let's find $ Y = 1 $ \\
	      The first bit is 1 and the remaining 4 bits can be any combination of 0s and 1s: $2^4$ \\
	      $ |Y=1| = 2^4 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(Y=1) = \frac{2^4}{2^5} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(Y=1) = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item Let's find $ X = 5 \cap Y = 1 $ \\
	      The first bit is 1, but that only leaves us with 4 other bits to make 0. Not 5 bits to make 0 \\
	      $ |X=5 \cap Y=1| = 0 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=5 \cap Y=1) = 0 $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's check \\
$ \Pr(X=5 \cap Y=1) = \Pr(X=5) \cdot \Pr(Y=1) $ \\
$ 0 = \frac{1}{2^5} \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ 0 = \frac{1}{2^6} $ \\
$ 0 = \frac{1}{64} $ \\
Because the two are not equal, it is no independent

\subsection{Question 22}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} One of Lindsay and Simon is chosen uniformly at random. \\
The person that is chosen wins 100.
Define the random variables $L$ and $S$ as follows:
$L = $ the amount that Lindsay wins
and
$S = $ the amount that Simon wins.
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Expected Values(6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's have a look, I guess
\begin{enumerate}
	\item To determine $ \mathbb{E}(L) $, we need to determine the probability that Lindsay wins \\
	      $ \Pr(L=100) = \frac{1}{2} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(L=0) = \frac{1}{2} $ \\
	      $ \mathbb{E}(L) = 100 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
	      $ \mathbb{E}(L) = 50 $
	\item To determine $ \mathbb{E}(S) $, we need to determine the probability that Simon wins \\
	      $ \Pr(S=100) = \frac{1}{2} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(S=0) = \frac{1}{2} $ \\
	      $ \mathbb{E}(S) = 100 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
	      $ \mathbb{E}(S) = 50 $
	\item Let's write out the set for  $ \text{max}(L,S) $ \\
	      $ \text{max}(L,S) = \{ (100, 0), (0, 100) \} $ \\
	      $ \mathbb{\text{max}(L,S)} = 100 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 100 \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
	      $ \mathbb{\text{max}(L,S)} = 100 $
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 24}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You repeatedly, and independently, roll two fair dice, until the sum of the values of the two dice is equal to 12. \\
Define the random variable $X$ to be the number of times you roll the pair of dice. What is the expected value of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Determining the Expectated Value (6.6.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
There are 36 possible ordered pairs of dice rolls. \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if the sum of the values of the two dice is 12 and 0 otherwise. \\
The probability of getting a sum of 12 is $ \frac{1}{36} $ because the only way to get a sum of 12 is to roll a 6 and a 6. \\
$ \Pr(X=1) = \frac{1}{36} $ \\
To find the expected value, we divide 1 by the probability of getting a sum of 12. \\
$ E(X) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{36}} $ \\
$ E(X) = 36 $

\subsection{Question 1}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a set $A$ having size 7 and a set $B$ having size 9. How many functions $f:A \rightarrow B$ are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Product Rule (3.1), Counting Functions (3.1.2) \\

Well, they aren't one-to-one functions, so each input has 7 possible outputs \\
The first input has 9 possible outputs \\
The second input has 9 possible outputs \\
\ldots \\
The seventh input has 9 possible outputs \\
$ 9^7 $

\subsection{Question 2}

\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Product Rule (3.1), Counting Functions (3.1.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
The first input has 9 possible outputs \\
The second input has 8 possible outputs \\
\ldots \\
The seventh input has 3 possible outputs \\
$ 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 $ \\
$ \frac{9!}{2!} $

\subsection{Question 3}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} How many bitstrings of length 55 start with 000 or end with 1010? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A be the event that a bitstring of length 55 starts with 000. \\
	      The first 3 bits are fixed as 000. \\
	      The remaining 52 bits can be any combination of 0s and 1s: $2^{52}$. \\
	      $ |A| = 2^{52} $
	\item Let B be the event that a bitstring of length 55 ends with 1010. \\
	      The last 4 bits are fixed as 1010. \\
	      The first 51 bits can be any combination of 0s and 1s: $2^{51}$. \\
	      $ |B| = 2^{51} $
	\item Let $ A \cap B $ be the event that a bitstring of length 55 starts with 000 AND ends with 1010. \\
	      The first 3 bits are fixed as 000. \\
	      The last 4 bits are fixed as 1010. \\
	      The remaining 48 bits can be any combination of 0s and 1s: $2^{48}$. \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 2^{48} $
\end{enumerate}
Since it's asking for OR, we need to find $ A \cup B $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = 2^{52} + 2^{51} - 2^{48} $

\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.1.1), The Complement Rule (3.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's explain why some are wrong and some are right
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The number of bitstrings of length $n$ that have at leats two 1's \\
	      If this was the case, it would subtract the set with all 0's and the set with a single 1 in any of the $n$ positions: $ 2^{n} - 1 - n $
	\item The number of bitstrings of length $n$ that have at most two 1's. \\
	      If this was the case, it would just be the set with all 0's and the set with a single 1 in any of the $n$ positions: $ 1 + n $
	\item The number of subsets of a set of size $n$ that have size at least two. \\
	      This one is saying \enquote{All subsets that are at least size two} \\
	      We subtract the empty set and choosing 1 element from the n elements: $ 2^{n} - 1 - n $
	\item The number of subsets of a set of size $n$ that have size at least three. \\
	      This one is saying \enquote{All subsets that are at least size three} \\
	      We subtract the empty set, choosing 1 element from the n elements, and choosing 2 elements from the n elements: $ 2^{n} - 1 - n - \binom{n}{2} $
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 5}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} In a group of 100 students,

25 drink cider,
50 drink beer,
33 do not drink cider and do not drink beer.

How many people in this group drink both cider and beer? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5), De Morgan's Law (no corresponding chapter) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all students. \\
	      $ |S| = 100 $
	\item Let C be the event that someone drinks cider \\
	      $ |C| = 25 $
	\item Let B be the event that someone drinks beer \\
	      $ |B| = 50 $
	\item Let $ \overline{C} \cap \overline{B} $ be the event that someone does not drink cider and does not drink beer \\
	      $ | \overline{C} \cap \overline{B} | = 33 $
\end{enumerate}
Find the union of C and B \\
$ |C \cup B| = |S| - | \overline{C} \cap \overline{B} | $ \\
$ |C \cup B| = 100 - 33 $ \\
$ |C \cup B| = 67 $ \\
Now, we find the intersection of C and B \\
$ |C \cup B| = |C| + |B| - |C \cap B| $ \\
$ 67 = 25 + 50 - |C \cap B| $ \\
$ |C \cap B| = 8 $

\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Complement Rule (3.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A be the event that there are two $a$'s\\
	      Out of n positions, choose 2 of them to be $a$'s: $ \binom{n}{2} $ \\
	      Everything else is a $b$, which is only 1 option. \\
	      $ |A| = \binom{n}{2} $
	\item Let B be the event that there are two $a$'s and they are next to each other \\
	      Out of n-1 positions, choose 1 of them to be the first $a$. \\
	      The next position is the second $a$. \\
	      Everything else is a $b$, which is only 1 option. \\
	      $ |B| = n-1 $

$f(0) = 1$,
$f(n) = \frac{5}{n} \cdot f(n-1)$ for all integers $n \geq 1$.
Which of the following is true for all $n \geq 0$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Recursive Functions (4.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's calculate $f(1)$ and $f(2)$ \\
$ f(1) = \frac{5}{1} \cdot f(0) = 5 \cdot 1 = 5 $ \\
$ f(2) = \frac{5}{2} \cdot f(1) = \frac{5}{2} \cdot 5 = \frac{25}{2} $
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ f(n) = \frac{5}{n!} $ \\
	      $ f(1) = \frac{5}{1!} = 5 $ \\
	      $ f(2) = \frac{5}{2!} = \frac{5}{2} $
	\item $ f(n) = \frac{5^{n}}{n!} $ \\
	      $ f(1) = \frac{5^{1}}{1!} = 5 $ \\
	      $ f(2) = \frac{5^{2}}{2!} = \frac{25}{2} $
	\item $ f(n) = \frac{5^{n}}{(n+1)!} $ \\
	      $ f(1) = \frac{5^{1}}{2!} = \frac{5}{2} $ \\
	      $ f(2) = \frac{5^{2}}{3!} = \frac{25}{6} $
	\item $ f(n) = \frac{5^{n+1}}{n!} $ \\
	      $ f(1) = \frac{5^{1+1}}{1!} = 25 $ \\
	      $ f(2) = \frac{5^{2+1}}{2!} = \frac{125}{2} $

Since b is the only one that has the correct function, it is the answer

print \enquote{hello} \\
else if n is even then
Hello$(n/2)$ \\
else \\
Hello$(n-1)$ \\
Hello$(n-2)$ \\
end if \\
end procedure \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Recursive Functions (4.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's draw a recursive tree to find out how many times the word \enquote{hello} is printed when we run $HELLO(7)$. \\
\begin{forest}
	[HELLO$ (7) $
		[HELLO$ (6) $

						[HELLO$ (2) $
								[HELLO$ 1 $]

As can be seen, the word \enquote{hello} is printed 5 times when we run $HELLO(7)$.

\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Product Rule (3.1), Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Well, the first character can be $ \{a, b, c, d, e\} $: 5 \\
The second character can be $ \{a, b, c, d, e\} - \{ \text{first character} \} $: 4 \\
The third character can be $ \{a, b, c, d, e\} - \{ \text{second character} \} $: 4 \\

\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Solutions of Linear Equations (3.9.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem. \\
We have 4 dividers and 28 stars.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $x_1$ is the number of stars to the left of the first divider
	\item $x_2$ is the number of stars between the first and second dividers
	\item $x_3$ is the number of stars between the second and third dividers

What is $\Pr(B|A)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Conditional Probability (5.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's determine A \\
	      The possible outcomes are (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1) \\
	      $ |A| = 5 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{5}{36} $
	\item Let's determine $ A \cap B $ \\
	      The possible outcomes are (2,4) \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 1 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{36} $

$ \Pr(B|A) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(A)} $ \\
$ \Pr(B|A) = \frac{\frac{1}{36}}{\frac{5}{36}} $ \\
$ \Pr(B|A) = \frac{1}{5} $

\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's determine $ |V| $ \\
	      $ |V| = 20 $
	\item Let's determine $ |W| $ \\
	      $ |W| = 7 $
	\item Let's determine $ |A| $ \\
	      The number of ways to choose 4 even integers from 12 even integers: $ \binom{12}{4} $ \\

\subsection{Question 14}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We flip a fair coin three times; these flips are independent of each other. \\
These three coin flips give us a sequence of length three, where each symbol is $H$ or $T$. \\
Define the events (recall that 0 is even):
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ A = \text{ \enquote{ The number of H in the sequence is even } } $
	\item $ B = \text{ \enquote{ The sequence contains at least two consecutive H's } } $
\end{enumerate}
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's determine S \\
	      S is the set of all possible outcomes of the 3 coin flips \\
	      $ |S| = 2^3 = 8$
	\item Let's determine A \\
	      A occurs when we either get 0 or 2 heads \\
	      $ |A| = 4 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item Let's determine B \\
	      B occurs when we get 2 or 3 heads \\
	      $ |B| = 3 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{3}{8} $
	\item Let's determine $ A \cap B $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 2 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's check if A and B are independent \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{8} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{16} $ \\
Since the equation is false, A and B are not independent.

\subsection{Question 15}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We flip a fair coin three times; these flips are independent of each other. These three coin flips give us a sequence of length three, where each symbol is $H$ or $T$. Define the events

	      B occurs when we HHH and TTT don't happen, so the other 6 outcomes \\
	      $ |B| = 6 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{6}{8} $
	\item Let's determine $ A \cap B $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 3 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{3}{8} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's check if A and B are independent \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{3}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{6}{8} $ \\
$ \frac{3}{8} = \frac{6}{16} $ \\
Since the equation is true, A and B are independent.

\subsection{Question 16}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 2$ be the number of students who are writing this exam. \\
Each of these students has a uniformly random birthday, which is independent of the birthdays of the other students. \\
We ignore leap years; thus, the year has 365 days. Define the event \\
$A = $ \enquote{at least two students have their birthday on December 14}.
What is $\Pr(A)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Birthday Paradox (5.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's determine $ S $ \\
	      S is the set of all possible outcomes of the birthdays of the students \\
	      $ |S| = 365^n $ \\
	      $ \Pr(S) = \frac{365^n}{365^n} = 1 $
	\item Let's determine $ B $ \\
	      B is the set of all outcomes where no students have their birthday on December 14 \\
	      The first student has 364 possible birthdays \\
	      The second student has 364 possible birthdays \\
	      \ldots \\
	      The nth student has 364 possible birthdays \\
	      $ |B| = 364^n $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{364^n}{365^n} $
	\item Let's determine $ C $ \\
	      C is the set of all outcomes where exactly one student has their birthday on December 14 \\
	      Out of n students, choose 1 of them to have their birthday on December 14: $ \binom{n}{1} = n $ \\
	      The student with the birthday on December 14 has 1 possible birthday: 1 \\
	      The other students have 364 possible birthdays: $ 364^{n-1} $ \\
	      $ |C| = n \cdot 1 \cdot 364^{n-1} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(C) = \frac{n \cdot 1 \cdot 364^{n-1}}{365^n} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's determine $ A $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \Pr(S) - \Pr(B) - \Pr(C) $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = 1 - \frac{364^n}{365^n} - \frac{n \cdot 1 \cdot 364^{n-1}}{365^n} $

$A = $ \enquote{4 $\in Y$ or 7 $\in Y$}.
What is $\Pr(A)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Product Rule (3.1), The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's determine $ S $ \\
	      S is the set of all possible outcomes of the 17 students \\
	      $ |S| = \binom{100}{17} $
	\item Let's determine $ B $ \\
	      B occurs when 4 is in the subset \\
	      We choose 4: 1 \\
	      We choose 16 from the remaining 99: $ \binom{99}{16} $ \\
	      $ |B| = 1 \cdot \binom{99}{16} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{1 \cdot \binom{99}{16}}{\binom{100}{17}} $
	\item Let's determine $ C $ \\
	      C occurs when 7 is in the subset \\
	      We choose 17: 1 \\
	      We choose 16 from the remaining 99: $ \binom{99}{16} $ \\
	      $ |C| = 1 \cdot \binom{99}{16} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(C) = \frac{1 \cdot \binom{99}{16}}{\binom{100}{17}} $
	\item Let's determine $ B \cap C $ \\
	      We choose 17: 1 \\
	      We choose 4: 1 \\
	      We choose 15 from the remaining 98: $ \binom{98}{15} $ \\
	      $ |B \cap C| = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \binom{98}{15} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B \cap C) = \frac{1 \cdot 1 \cdot \binom{98}{15}}{\binom{100}{17}} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's determine $ A $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \Pr(B) + \Pr(C) - \Pr(B \cap C) $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{1 \cdot \binom{99}{16}}{\binom{100}{17}} + \frac{1 \cdot \binom{99}{16}}{\binom{100}{17}} - \frac{1 \cdot 1 \cdot \binom{98}{15}}{\binom{100}{17}} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{2 \cdot \binom{99}{16} - \binom{98}{15}}{\binom{100}{17}} $

$A = $ \enquote{in the permutation, both 8 and 4 are to the left of 3}.
What is $\Pr(A)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Discrete Probability (5) Warning: I can't find a direct chapter section, but question 5.73 from the textbook are very similar. I could be overthinking and believing there's a theory for this when there isn't \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
I'm not sure what the right way to do this is \\
Forget the other values, let's just focus on 3,4, and 8 \\
There are 3! ways to arrange 3,4, and 8: $ \{(3,4,8), (3,8,4), (4,3,8), (4,8,3), (8,3,4), (8,4,3) \} $
Out of those 6 ways, only 2 of them have 4 and 8 to the left of 3: $ \{ (4,8,3), (8,4,3) \} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} $

\subsection{Question 19}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer and let $a_1a_2\ldots a_n$ be a uniformly random permutation of the set ${1, 2, \ldots, n}$. \\
Let $X$ be the random variable with the value
$X = $ the number of indices $i$ with $1 \leq i \leq n-1$ and $a_i < a_{i+1}$.
For example, if $n=6$ and the permutation is $3, 5, 4, 1, 6, 2$, then $X=2$.
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$?
Hint: Use indicator random variables.
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Indicator Random Variables (6.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if the next number is greater than the current number and 0 otherwise. \\
The probability that a random number is greater than the previous number is $\frac{1}{2}$ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X_1 + X_2 + \text{\ldots} + X_{n-1}) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X_1) + \mathbb{E}(X_2) + \text{\ldots} + \mathbb{E}(X_{n-1}) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \text{\ldots} + \frac{1}{2} $ \\

\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer and consider a group $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n$ of $n$ people.
Each of these people has a uniformly random birthday, which is independent of the birthdays of the other people. We ignore leap years; thus, the year has 365 days.
Define the random variable $X$ to be the number of unordered pairs ${P_i, P_j}$ of people that have the same birthday.
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$?
Hint: Use indicator random variables.
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Birthday Paradox (5.5), The Law of Total Probability (5.9) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We take all possible unordered pairs by choosing 2 out of the n people: $ \binom{n}{2} $ \\
$P_i$'s birthday can be any day: $ \frac{365}{365} $ \\
$P_j$'s birthday must be the same day: $ \frac{1}{365} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \binom{n}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{365} $

\subsection{Question 21}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a coin that comes up heads with probability $1/7$ and comes up tails with probability $6/7$. \\
You flip this coin once. If it comes up heads, you win \$5. If it comes up tails, you win \$2. \\
Define the random variable $X$ to be the amount (in dollars) that you win. \\
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Basic Rules of Probability (5.3), Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's determine X=5 \\
	      The probability of getting heads is $ \frac{1}{7} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=5) = \frac{1}{7} $
	\item Let's determine X=2 \\
	      The probability of getting tails is $ \frac{6}{7} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=2) = \frac{6}{7} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 5 \cdot \Pr(X=5) + 2 \cdot \Pr(X=2) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 5 \cdot \frac{1}{7} + 2 \cdot \frac{6}{7} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{5}{7} + \frac{12}{7} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{17}{7} $

\subsection{Question 22}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You flip a fair coin 7 times; these coin flips are independent of each other. Define the random variables
$X = $ the number of heads in these 7 coin flips,
and
$Y = $ the number of tails in these 7 coin flips.
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } A Basic Property of Independent Events (5.11.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
For questions like these, we can answer by checking for a value $i$ if the following is true: $ \Pr(X=i \cap Y=i) = \Pr(X=i) \cdot \Pr(Y=i) $
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's determine $ \Pr(X=1) $ \\
	      The coin that's heads has a probability of $ \frac{1}{2} $ \\
	      The other 6 coins have a probability of $ \frac{1}{2} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=1) = { \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)}^1 {\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) }^6 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=1) = \frac{1}{2^7} $
	\item Let's determine $ \Pr(Y=1) $ \\
	      The coin that's tails has a probability of $ \frac{1}{2} $ \\
	      The other 6 coins have a probability of $ \frac{1}{2} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(Y=1) = { \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) }^1 { \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) }^6 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(Y=1) = \frac{1}{2^7} $
	\item Let's determine $ \Pr(X=1 \cap Y=1) $ \\
	      If we get exactly 1 heads, then the remaining 6 coins must be tails \\
	      but that means we can't have exactly 1 tails as well \\
	      Since having both happen at the same time is impossible \\
	      $ \Pr(X=1 \cap Y=1) = 0 $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(X=i \cap Y=i) = \Pr(X=i) \cdot \Pr(Y=i) $ \\
$ 0 = \frac{1}{2^7} \cdot \frac{1}{2^7} $ \\
Since the equation is false, X and Y are not independent.

\]
and
\[ Y = \begin{cases}

\]
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } A Basic Property of Independent Events (5.11.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
For questions like these, we can answer by checking for a value $i$ if the following is true: $ \Pr(X=i \cap Y=i) = \Pr(X=i) \cdot \Pr(Y=i) $
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's determine $ \Pr(X=1) $ \\
	      Since half the numbers are odd, \\
	      $ \Pr(X=1) = \frac{5}{10} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=1) = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item Let's determine $ \Pr(Y=1) $ \\
	      Since 4 of the numbers are in the set {3, 4, 5, 6}, \\
	      $ \Pr(Y=1) = \frac{4}{10} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(Y=1) = \frac{2}{5} $
	\item Let's determine $ \Pr(X=1 \cap Y=1) $ \\
	      The values 3 and 5 are the only values that are both odd and in the set {3, 4, 5, 6} \\
	      $ \Pr(X=1 \cap Y=1) = \frac{2}{10} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=1 \cap Y=1) = \frac{1}{5} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(X=1 \cap Y=1) = \Pr(X=1) \cdot \Pr(Y=1) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{5} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{5} $ \\
Since the equation is true, X and Y are independent.

\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You repeatedly and independently roll a fair die until the result of the roll is divisible by 3. \\
Define the random variable $X$ to be the number of times you roll the die. \\
For example, if the results of the rolls are $4, 5, 1, 4, 3$, then $X=5$. \\
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Determining the Expectated Value (6.6.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's find the probability of rolling a number that is divisible by 3 \\
The numbers that are divisible by 3 are 3 and 6 \\
$ \Pr(X=1) = \frac{2}{6} $ \\
We can use the geometric distribution to find the expected value of X \\
Basically, just do $ \frac{1}{p} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{1}{\frac{2}{6}} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 3 $









\section{2017 Fall Final}
\subsection{Question 1}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You are given 20 beer bottles $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_{20}$ and 30 cider bottles $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_{30}$. Assume you arrange these 50 bottles on a horizontal line such that

the leftmost 10 bottles are all beer bottles, and
the rightmost 10 bottles are all cider bottles.

How many such arrangements are there? (The order of the bottles matters.)
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Product Rule(3.1), Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Okay, so let's break it down
\begin{enumerate}
	\item First, there are 10 beer bottles on the leftmost side: 1
	\item This means we need to choose 10 beer bottles out of the 20 beer bottles: $ \binom{20}{10} $
	\item We also need to calculate how many ways there are to arrange the 10 beer bottles
	      The first bottle can be placed in any of the first ten leftmost positions: 10 \\
	      The second bottle can be placed in any of the remaining nine positions: 9 \\
	      \ldots \\
	      The tenth bottle can be placed in the last remaining position: 1 \\
	      $ 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 10! $
	\item There are also 10 cider bottles on the rightmost side: 1
	\item This means we need to choose 10 cider bottles out of the 30 cider bottles: $ \binom{30}{10} $
	\item We also need to calculate how many ways there are to arrange the 10 cider bottles
	      The first bottle can be placed in any of the first ten rightmost positions: 10 \\
	      The second bottle can be placed in any of the remaining nine positions: 9 \\
	      \ldots \\
	      The tenth bottle can be placed in the last remaining position: 1 \\
	      $ 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 10! $
	\item Now, we've calculated the leftmost and rightmost bottles but not the permutations for the remaining 10 beer bottles and 20 cider bottles \\
	      The first remaining bottle can be placed in any of the remainining 30 inner positions: 30 \\
	      The second remaining bottle can be placed in any of the remaining 29 positions: 29 \\
	      \ldots \\
	      The thirtieth remaining bottle can be placed in the last remaining position: 1 \\
	      $ 30 \cdot 29 \cdot 28 \cdot 27 \cdot 26 \cdot 25 \cdot 24 \cdot 23 \cdot 22 \cdot 21 \cdot 20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18 \cdot 17 \cdot 16 \cdot 15 \cdot 14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 30! $
\end{enumerate}
In total, there are $ \binom{20}{10} \cdot 10! \cdot \binom{30}{10} \cdot 10! \cdot 30! $ ways to arrange the bottles.

\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 2$ be an even integer. A permutation $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ of the set ${1, 2, \ldots, n}$ is called awesome if $a_2 = 2 \cdot a_1$.
For example, if $n = 6$, then the permutation $3, 6, 4, 1, 5, 2$ is awesome, whereas the permutation $3, 5, 4, 1, 6, 2$ is not awesome.
How many awesome permutations of the set ${1, 2, \ldots, n}$ are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Product Rule (3.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's break it down \\
There is an integer $a_1$ and then its double $a_2$ \\
The largest value is $n$ and its half is $n/2$ \\
The second largest value is $n-2$ and its half is $\frac{n-2}{2}$ \\
We subtract 2 since odd numbers have no halves \\
This pattern tells us that starting from n, every other value decrementing results in a double and integer \\
When we rephrase this statement, we're saying half of the values from n to 2 are doubles of some values in the set \\
We can take the integer and its double and place it at the front \\
This means there are possibly $ \frac{n}{2} $ pairs \\
The remaining $n-2$ integers can be arranged in $ (n-2)! $ ways \\
In total, there are $ \frac{n}{2} \cdot (n-2)! $ awesome permutations of the set ${1, 2, \ldots, n}$.

\subsection{Question 3}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings consisting of 40 characters, where each character is one of the letters $a, b$, and $c$. Such a string is called cool if

it contains exactly 8 many $a$'s

or

it contains exactly 7 many $b$'s.

How many cool strings are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Product Rule (3.1), The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A be the set of strings that contain exactly 8 many $a$'s \\
	      We choose 8 positions out of the 40 positions for the $a$'s: $ \binom{40}{8} $ \\
	      The remaining 32 positions can be filled with either $b$ or $c$: $ 2^{32} $ \\
	      $ |A| = \binom{40}{8} \cdot 2^{32} $
	\item Let B be the set of strings that contain exactly 7 many $b$'s \\
	      We choose 7 positions out of the 40 positions for the $b$'s: $ \binom{40}{7} $ \\
	      The remaining 33 positions can be filled with either $a$ or $c$: $ 2^{33} $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{40}{7} \cdot 2^{33} $
	\item Let $ A \cap B $ be the set of strings that contain exactly 8 many $a$'s and 7 many $b$'s \\
	      We choose 15 positions out of the 40 positions for the $a$'s and $b$'s: $ \binom{40}{15} $ \\
	      Within those 15 positions, we choose 8 of them to be $a$'s: $ \binom{15}{8} $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = \binom{40}{15} \cdot \binom{15}{8} $
\end{enumerate}
In total, there are $ \binom{40}{8} \cdot 2^{32} + \binom{40}{7} \cdot 2^{33} - \binom{40}{15} \cdot \binom{15}{8} $ cool strings.

\subsection{Question 4}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings consisting of 40 characters, where each character is one of the letters $a, b$, and $c$. \\
How many such strings contain at least three $a$'s? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Complement Rule (3.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all strings \\
	      $ |S| = 3^{40} $
	\item Let A be the set of strings that contain no $a$'s \\
	      The 40 positions can be filled with either $b$ or $c$: $ 2^{40} $ \\
	      $ |A| = 2^{40} $
	\item Let B be the set of strings that contain exactly one $a$ \\
	      We choose 1 position out of the 40 positions for the $a$: $ \binom{40}{1} $ \\
	      The remaining 39 positions can be filled with either $b$ or $c$: $ 2^{39} $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{40}{1} \cdot 2^{39} $
	\item Let C be the set of strings that contain exactly two $a$'s \\
	      We choose 2 positions out of the 40 positions for the $a$'s: $ \binom{40}{2} $ \\
	      The remaining 38 positions can be filled with either $b$ or $c$: $ 2^{38} $ \\
	      $ |C| = \binom{40}{2} \cdot 2^{38} $
\end{enumerate}
Let D be the set of strings that contain at least three $a$'s \\
$ |D| = |S| - |A| - |B| - |C| $ \\
$ |D| = 3^{40} - 2^{40} - \binom{40}{1} \cdot 2^{39} - \binom{40}{2} \cdot 2^{38} $

\subsection{Question 5}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 3$ and $m \geq 3$ be integers. What does
$\binom{n}{3} + \binom{m}{3} + n \cdot \binom{m}{2} + m \cdot \binom{n}{2}$
count? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.1.1), The Complement Rule (3.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's explain why some are wrong and one is right
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The number of subsets having size 3 of a set consisting of $n$ positive numbers and $m$ negative numbers. \\
	      This one is right because it lets us pick 3 positive numbers OR 3 negative numbers OR 1 positive number and 2 negative numbers OR 1 negative number and 2 positive numbers
	\item The number of subsets having size at most 3 of a set consisting of $n$ positive numbers and $m$ negative numbers. \\
	      this one is incorrect because the equation given misses sets of size 1 and 2
	      For instance, should've said $ \binom{n}{1} + \ldots $ but they didn't
	\item The number of subsets having size 2 or 3 of a set consisting of $n$ positive numbers and $m$ negative numbers. \\
	      This one is incorrect because the equation given misses sets of size 1
	      For instance, should've said $ \binom{n}{1} + \ldots $ but they didn't
	\item The number of subsets having size 2 and 3 of a set consisting of $n$ positive numbers and $m$ negative numbers. \\
	      Uh, a set can't be of both size 2 and 3 at the same time. If I have 2 balls, I don't have 3 balls. If I have 3 balls, I don't have 2 balls
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 6}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a group of 100 students. In this group,

13 students like Donald Trump,
25 students like Justin Bieber, and
8 students like Donald Trump and like Justin Bieber.

How many students do not like Donald Trump and do not like Justin Bieber? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5), De Morgan's Law (no corresponding chapter) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let D be the set of students that like Donald Trump \\
	      $ |D| = 13 $
	\item Let B be the set of students that like Justin Bieber \\
	      $ |B| = 25 $
	\item Let $ D \cap B $ be the set of students that like both Donald Trump and Justin Bieber \\
	      $ |D \cap B| = 8 $
\end{enumerate}
Let's find $ |D \cup B| $ \\
$ |D \cup B| = |D| + |B| - |D \cap B| $ \\
$ |D \cup B| = 13 + 25 - 8 $ \\
$ |D \cup B| = 30 $ \\
We're looking for $ | \overline{D} \cap \overline{B} | = 100 - |D \cup B| $ \\
$ | \overline{D} \cap \overline{B} | = 100 - 30 $ \\
$ | \overline{D} \cap \overline{B} | = 70 $

\subsection{Question 7}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} How many strings can be obtained by rearranging the letters of the word BOOKKEEPER? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Reordering the Letters of a Word (3.9.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item B 1
	\item P 1
	\item R 1
	\item O 2
	\item K 2
	\item E 3
\end{enumerate}
First, we choose 2 of the 10 positions for the $O$'s: $ \binom{10}{2} $ \\
Then, we choose 2 of the remaining 8 positions for the $K$'s: $ \binom{8}{2} $ \\
Then, we choose 3 of the remaining 6 positions for the $E$'s: $ \binom{6}{3} $ \\
Then we choose 1 of the remaining 3 positions for the $B$: $ \binom{3}{1} $ \\
Then we choose 1 of the remaining 2 positions for the $P$: $ \binom{2}{1} $ \\
Then we choose 1 of the remaining 1 positions for the $R$: $ \binom{1}{1} $ \\
Adding it up is $ \binom{10}{2} \cdot \binom{8}{2} \cdot \binom{6}{3} \cdot \binom{3}{1} \cdot \binom{2}{1} \cdot \binom{1}{1} $ \\
Simplifying, we get $ \frac{10!}{2!} \cdot \frac{8!}{2!} \cdot \frac{6!}{3!} \cdot 3! $

\subsection{Question 8}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings consisting of characters, where each character is one of the letters $a, b$, and $c$.
For any integer $n \geq 1$, let $E_n$ be the number of strings of length $n$ that contain an even number of $c$'s, and let $O_n$ be the number of such strings of length $n$ that contain an odd number of $c$'s. (Remember that 0 is an even number.)
Which of the following is true for any integer $n \geq 2$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } A Recursively Defined Set (4.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Well, let's write out and see what happens. We start off with an even number of $c$'s, which is 0 \\
If we place an $a$, then we still have an even number of $c$'s, so we call the even number of $c$'s $E_{n-1}$ \\
If we place a $b$, then we still have an even number of $c$'s, so we call the even number of $c$'s $E_{n-1}$ \\
If we place a $c$, then we now have an odd number of $c$'s, so we call the odd number of $c$'s $O_{n-1}$ \\
This means that $E_n = E_{n-1} + E_{n-1} + O_{n-1} = 2E_{n-1} + O_{n-1}$

\subsection{Question 9}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider bitstrings that do not contain 110. Let $S_n$ be the number of such strings having length $n$. \\
Which of the following is true for any $n \geq 4$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } A Recursively Defined Set (4.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's write out and see what happens. We start off with a bitstring that does not contain 110 \\
$ 0, S_{n1} $ \\
$ 0, 1, S_{n-2} $ \\
In the above, all possible combos start with 0. There is also the possibility of having all 1's: 1 \\
Adding it up, $ S_n = S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} + 1 $

\subsection{Question 10}

IFeelLikeSinging$ (n+1) $ \\
else \\
IFeelLikeSinging$ ( \frac{n}{2} ) $ \\
IFeelLikeSinging$ ( \frac{n}{2}-1 ) $ \\
end if \\
end procedure \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Recursive Functions (4.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's draw out the tree \\
To fit the tree on the page, IFLS = IFeelLikeSinging \\

\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Assume you write a multiple-choice exam that has 25 questions. For each question, four options are given to you, and exactly one of these options is the correct answer.
Assume that you answer each question uniformly at random, where the choices for different questions are independent of each other.

\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Determining the Expected Value (6.7.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X$ be the number of questions answered correctly. \\
The probability of getting a question correct is $ \frac{1}{4} $ \\
$X \sim \text{Binomial}(25, 1/4)$ \\
$ \Pr(X=17) = \binom{25}{17} {\left( \frac{1}{4} \right)}^{17} {\left( \frac{3}{4} \right)}^{25-17} $ \\
$ \Pr(X=17) = \binom{25}{17} {\left( \frac{1}{4} \right)}^{17} {\left( \frac{3}{4} \right)}^{8} $

\subsection{Question 12}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A bitstring $b_1b_2\ldots b_n$ of length $n$ is called a palindrome if
$b_1b_2 \ldots b_{n-1}b_n = b_n b_{n-1} \ldots b_2b_1$,
i.e., reading the string from left to right gives the same result as reading the string from right to left.
Let $n \geq 2$ be an even integer. You are given a uniformly random bitstring of length $n$. What is the probability that this bitstring is a palindrome? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Product Rule (3.1), Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), Uniform Probability Spaces (4.4)\\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Well, let's break it down
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A be the event that a string of length n is a palindrome \\
	      The leftmost bit can be 1 or 0: 2 possibilities \\
	      The rightmost bit must be the same as the leftmost bit: 1 possibility \\
	      The second leftmost bit can be 1 or 0: 2 possibilities \\
	      The second rightmost bit must be the same as the second leftmost bit: 1 possibility \\
	      \ldots \\
	      The innermost leftmost bit can be 1 or 0: 2 possibilities \\
	      The innermost rightmost bit must be the same as the innermost leftmost bit: 1 possibility \\
	      $ |A| = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot \ldots \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 2^{n/2} $
	\item Let S be the set of all bitstrings of length n \\
	      $ |S| = 2^n $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = {\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)}^{n/2} $

\subsection{Question 13}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $X = {1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10}$. Let $Y$ be a uniformly random subset of $X$. Define the events
$A = $ \enquote{$Y$ contains at least 4 elements},
$B = $ \enquote{all elements of $Y$ are even}.
What is $\Pr(A|B)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Bijection Rule (3.2.1), Conditional Probability (5.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's find the values
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all subsets of X \\
	      $ |S| = 2^{10} $
	\item Let's determine $ \Pr(B) $ \\
	      The even numbers in X are $ \{ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 \} $ \\
	      There are 5 elements to make subsets out of, so let's get this bread then \\
	      $ |B| = 2^25 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{|B|}{|S|} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{2^5}{2^{10}} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{1}{2^5} $
	\item Let's determine $ \Pr( A \cap B) $ \\
	      The even numbers in X are $ \{ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 \} $ \\
	      The number of subsets of X that contain at least 4 even numbers is $ \binom{5}{4} + \binom{5}{5} = 6 $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 6 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|S|} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{6}{2^{10}} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{3}{2^9} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's find $ \Pr(A|B) $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\frac{3}{2^9}}{\frac{1}{2^5}} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{3}{2^4} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{3}{16} $

In both bitstrings, each bit is 0 with probability $1/2$, and 1 with probability $1/2$ (independent of all other bits). \\
Consider the string $a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, \ldots, a_n + b_n$. \\
What is the probability that each element in this string is non-zero? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Uniform Probability Spaces (4.4), The Product Rule (3.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's break it down again
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all pairs of bitstrings of length n \\
	      $ \{ (0+0), (1+0), (0+1), (1+1) \} $ \\
	      $ |S| = 4 $
	\item Let A be the set of pairs of bitstrings where each element in the string is non-zero \\
	      $ \{ (1+0), (0+1), (1+1) \} $ \\
	      $ |A| = 3 $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{3}{4} $ \\
We can repeat the process for all n pairs \\
The probability of all n pairs being non-zero is $ { \left( \frac{3}{4} \right) }^n $

Now, let's check if A and B are independent \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{2}{8} \cdot \frac{4}{8} $ \\
$ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{8} $ \\
Since the equation is false, A and B are not independent.

$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{2}{9} = \frac{6}{9} \cdot \frac{4}{9} $ \\

\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You flip a fair red coin once, and you flip a fair blue coin once, independently of each other. Define the random variables

\[ X = \begin{cases}
		1 \text{ if the red coin flip resulted in heads,}\
		0 \text{ if the red coin flip resulted in tails,}\
	\end{cases}
\]
\[ Y = \begin{cases}
		1 \text{ if the blue coin flip resulted in heads,}\
		0 \text{ if the blue coin flip resulted in tails,}\
	\end{cases}
\]
and
$Z = \text{max}(X,Y)$.
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(Z)$ of the random variable $Z$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 10
	\item 11
	\item 00
	\item 01
\end{enumerate}
Let's find the individual Expected probabilities for Z \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 1 \cdot \Pr(X=1 \cap Y=0) + 1 \cdot (X=1 \cap Y=1) + 0 \cdot \Pr(X=0 \cap Y=0) + 1 \cdot \Pr(X=0 \cap Y=1) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{3}{4} $

\subsection{Question 19}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. Consider a bitstring $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ of length $n$, in which each bit $b_i$ is 0 with probability $1/2$, and 1 with probability $1/2$ (independent of all other bits).
Define the random variable $X$ to be the number of indices $i$ with $1 \leq i < n$ for which $b_i \neq b_{i+1}$.
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$?
Hint: Use indicator random variables.
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Uniform Probability Spaces (4.4), Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
All this to say that the current bit is different from the next bit
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all pairs of bits of length n \\
	      $ S = \{ (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) \} $ \\
	      $ |S| = 4^n $
	\item Let A be the event that the current bit is different from the next bit \\
	      $ A = \{ (0,1), (1,0) \} $ \\
	      $ |A| = 2 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} $
\end{enumerate}
Since we're considering the current bit and its next bit, we don't consider the last bit since there's no bit after the last bit \\
This means we have n-1 pairs \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} 1 \cdot \Pr(A) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = (n-1) \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{n-1}{2} $ \\
The expected value of X is $ \frac{n-1}{2} $

\subsection{Question 20}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You choose a uniformly random element, say $a$, from the set ${1, 2, \ldots, 100}$, and you choose a uniformly random element, say $b$, from the same set ${1, 2, \ldots,100}$.
($a$ and $b$ are chosen independently of each other.) Define the random variable $X$ to be $X =$ max$(a, b)$.
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's explain why some are wrong and one is right
\begin{enumerate}
	\item ${\sum_{k=1}^{100}} k \cdot \frac{k^{2}}{100^{2}}$ \\
	      This equation says, \enquote{The probability that k is the max value and each value has 1 to k values to be} \\
	      This doesn't work because it's saying that the max value is k if $a$ is 1 and $b$ is 1
	\item ${\sum_{k=1}^{100}} k \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{100^{2}}$
	      This equation says, \enquote{a can be any value from 1 to k and b can be any value from 1 to k-1} \\
	      This doesn't work because it's saying that the max value is k if $a$ is $k-1$ and $b$ is $k-2$
	\item ${\sum_{k=1}^{100}} k \cdot \frac{2k}{100^{2}}$ \\
	      This equation says, \enquote{a can be any value from 1 to k and b can be any value from 1 to k} \\
	      This doesn't work because it's saying that the max value is k if $a$ is 1 and $b$ is 1
	\item ${\sum_{k=1}^{100}} k \cdot \bigg(\frac{1+2(k-1)}{100^{2}}\bigg)$ \\
	      This one actually has multiple possibilities
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item $a = k$ and $b = k$: 1 possibility
		      \item $a = k$ and $b$ is any value less than k: $k(k-1)$ possibilities
		      \item $a$ is any value less than k and $b = k$: $(k-1)k$ possibilities
	      \end{enumerate}
	      Summing them up, we get $1 + 2 \cdot k(k-1) $ \\
	      Each of the tree posibilities above makes sure that the max value is k
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 21}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You are given a fair red die and a fair blue die. You roll each die once, independently of each other. Let $(i,j)$ be the outcome, where $i$ is the result of the red die and $j$ is the result of the blue die. Define the random variables
$X = i + j$
and
$Y = i - j$.
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } A Basic Property of Independent Events (5.11.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Before drawing a tree, let's think for a second \\
We just need to prove whether the following is true for some value $x$ and $y$: $ \Pr(X=i \cap Y=j) = \Pr(X=i) \cdot \Pr(Y=j) $ \\
Let's do it for X=2 and Y=2 \\
$ |S| = 36 $ \\
$X=2$ for the pair $ (1,1) $ \\
$ \Pr(X=2) = \frac{1}{36} $ \\
$Y=5$ for the pairs $ (6,1), (1,6) $ \\
$ \Pr(Y=5) = \frac{2}{36} $ \\
Now, let's find the case of $ X=2 \cap Y=5 $ \\
When we look at overlapping pairs in $X=2$ and $Y=5$, we see that there is no intersection \\
This means that $ \Pr(X=2 \cap Y=5) = 0 $ \\
$ \Pr(X=2 \cap Y=5) = \Pr(X=2) \cdot \Pr(Y=5) $ \\
Since the equation is false, X and Y are not independent.

\subsection{Question 22}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Alexa and Shelly want to play the game of Monopoly. \\
They use the following recursive algorithm to decide who goes first. \\
The ladies run algorithm $WhoGoesFirst(1)$, i.e., with $k = 1$. \\
Define the random variable $X$ to be the value of the output of this algorithm. \\
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$? \\
procedure WhoGoesFirst$ (k) $ \\
$ k \geq 1 $, the die is fair and all rolls are independent \\
Alexa rolls the die, let $a$ be the result \\
Shelly rolls the die, let $s$ be the result \\
if $a > s$ then \\
print \enquote{Alexa goes first} \\
return $k$ \\
end if \\
if $a < s$ then \\
print \enquote{Shelly goes first} \\
return $k$ \\
end if \\
if $a = s$ then \\
WhoGoesFirst$ (k+1) $ \\
end if \\
end procedure \\

Let's just think about this logically \\

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
The probability of returning k or having 2 different rolls is $ \frac{30}{36} $ \\
On Allah, I swear there's a rule that states that we expect to need 1/p attempts until the thing actually happens? Geometric Distribution?
$ p = \frac{30}{36} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{1}{p} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{1}{\frac{30}{36}} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{36}{30} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{6}{5} $

\subsection{Question 24}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n$ and $k$ be integers such that $n$ is even, $n \geq 2$, and $1 \leq k \leq n$.
The Carleton Computer Science Society (CCSS) is having their annual Christmas Holiday Season Party, which is attended by $n$ students.


$k$ of these $n$ students are politically correct and, thus, refuse to say Merry Christmas. Instead, they say Happy Holidays.
$n-k$ of these $n$ students do not care about political correctness and, thus, they say Merry Christmas.

Consider a uniformly random permutation of these $n$ students. The positions in this permutation are numbered as $1, 2, \ldots, n$.
Define the following random variable $X$:
$X = $ the number of positions $i$ with $1 \leq i \leq n/2$ such that both students at positions $i$ and $2i$ are politically correct.
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$?
Hint: Use indicator random variables.
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Indicator Random Variables (6.4), Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if the students at positions $i$ and $2i$ are politically correct
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be all possible combinations \\
	      We choose k positions for the politically correct students: $ \binom{n}{k} $ \\
	      $ |S| = \binom{n}{k} $
	\item Let $X_i=1$ be the event that the students at positions $i$ and $2i$ are politically correct \\
	      2 students at those positions are both politicall correct
	      We choose k-2 positions for the politically correct out of n-2 remaining positions: $ \binom{n-2}{k-2} $ \\
	      $ |X_i=1| = \binom{n-2}{k-2} $
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{X_i=1|}{|S|} $
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{\binom{n-2}{k-2}}{\binom{n}{k}} $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{\frac{ (n-2)! }{ (k-2)! (n-k)! }}{\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)! }} $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{ (n-2)! }{ (k-2)! (n-k)! } \cdot \frac{k! (n-k)!}{n!} $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{ (n-2)! }{ (k-2)! (n-k)! } \cdot \frac{k! (n-k)!}{n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2)!} $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{ 1 }{ (k-2)! (n-k)! } \cdot \frac{k! (n-k)!}{n \cdot (n-1) } $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{ 1 }{ (k-2)! } \cdot \frac{k!}{n \cdot (n-1) } $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{ 1 }{ (k-2)! } \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k-1) \cdot (k-2)! }{n \cdot (n-1) } $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{ 1 }{ 1 } \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k-1) \cdot 1 }{n \cdot (n-1) } $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{k \cdot (k-1) }{n \cdot (n-1) } $
\end{enumerate}
Well, $S_n$ corresponds to $S_{ \frac{n}{2} }$ \\
$S_{n-2}$ corresponds to $S_{\frac{n}{2}-1}$ \\
$S_{n-4}$ corresponds to $S_{\frac{n}{2}-2}$ \\
Half of everyone has a corresponding junior \\
$ E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n/2} \Pr(X_i=1) $ \\
$ E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n/2} \frac{k \cdot (k-1) }{n \cdot (n-1) } $ \\
$ E(X) = \frac{k (k-1) }{n (n-1) } \cdot \frac{n}{2} $










\section{2017 Winter Final}
\subsection{Question 1}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider permutations $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{10}$ of the set $ \{1, 2, \ldots, 10 \} $ for which \\
$a_1, a_3, a_5, a_7, a_9$ are all odd and
$a_2, a_4, a_6, a_8, a_{10}$ are all even.
How many such permutations are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Product Rule (3.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Well, let's break it down
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We can place the first odd number in any of the 5 odd positions: 5 \\
	      We can place the second odd number in any of the 4 remaining odd positions: 4 \\
	      \ldots \\
	      We can place the last odd number in the last remaining odd position: 1 \\
	      This creates $ 5! $ permutations
	\item We can place the first even number in any of the 5 even positions: 5 \\
	      We can place the second even number in any of the 4 remaining even positions: 4 \\
	      \ldots \\
	      We can place the last even number in the last remaining even position: 1 \\
	      This creates $ 5! $ permutations
\end{enumerate}
Multiplying the two permutations, we get $ 5! \cdot 5! $

\subsection{Question 2}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. Consider permutations $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ of the set ${1, 2, \ldots, n}$ for which $a_1 < a_2$. How many such permutations are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Product Rule (3.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Well, let's break it down \\
We choose 2 numbers out of the n numbers: $ \binom{n}{2} $ \\
The other n-2 numbers can be placed in any order: $ (n-2)! $ \\
$ \binom{n}{2} \cdot (n-2)! $ \\
$ = \frac{n!}{2! \cdot (n-2)!} \cdot (n-2)! $ \\
$ = \frac{n!}{2!} $

\subsection{Question 3}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $B$ be a set consisting of 45 bottles. Out of these, 17 are beer bottles, and the remaining 28 are cider bottles. Consider subsets of $B$ that contain
exactly 5 beer bottles and zero or more cider bottles,
or
exactly 5 cider bottles and zero or more beer bottles.
How many such subsets are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Bijection Rule (3.2.1), The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Holy moly, that's a lot of words \\
Let's do this anyway$ ( $cries internally $ ) $
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let B be the event that we have exactly 5 beer bottles and zero or more cider bottles \\
	      First, we choose 5 beer bottles out of the 17 beer bottles: $ \binom{17}{5} $ \\
	      Then, choose how many cider bottles we want. We subsets with 0 cider bottles to 28 cider bottles \\
	      Somewhere out there, there's a rule that states that it's $ 2^{28} $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{17}{5} \cdot 2^{28} $
	\item Let C be the event that we have exactly 5 cider bottles and zero or more beer bottles \\
	      First, we choose 5 cider bottles out of the 28 cider bottles: $ \binom{28}{5} $ \\
	      Then, choose how many beer bottles we want. We subsets with 0 beer bottles to 17 beer bottles \\
	      Somewhere out there, there's a rule that states that it's $ 2^{17} $ \\
	      $ |C| = \binom{28}{5} \cdot 2^{17} $
	\item Determine $ B \cap C $ \\
	      We have exactly 5 beer bottles and 5 cider bottles \\
	      $ | B \cap C | = \binom{17}{5} \cdot \binom{28}{5} $
\end{enumerate}
$ B \cup C = |B| + |C| - |B \cap C| $ \\
$ B \cup C = \binom{17}{5} \cdot 2^{28} + \binom{28}{5} \cdot 2^{17} - \binom{17}{5} \cdot \binom{28}{5} $

\subsection{Question 4}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A bitstring $b_1b_2 \ldots b_n$ is called a palindrome if $b_1b_2 \ldots b_n = b_n b_{n-1} \ldots b_1$, i.e., reading the string from left to right gives the same result as reading it from right to left. \\
Let $n \geq 3$ be an odd integer.
How many palindromes of length $n$ are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Product Rule (3.1), Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let A be the event that a string of length n is a palindrome \\
The leftmost bit can be 1 or 0: 2 possibilities \\
The rightmost bit must be the same as the leftmost bit: 1 possibility \\
The second leftmost bit can be 1 or 0: 2 possibilities \\
The second rightmost bit must be the same as the second leftmost bit: 1 possibility \\
\ldots \\
The innermost leftmost bit can be 1 or 0: 2 possibilities \\
The innermost rightmost bit must be the same as the innermost leftmost bit: 1 possibility \\
$ |A| = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot \ldots \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 2^{n/2} $ \\
Usually, this would be right; however, we know the middle bit is always the same as itself AND n/2 is a fraction since n is odd \\
$ |A| = 2^{\frac{n+1}{2}} $

\subsection{Question 5}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. What does $2^{n} - 2^{n-2}$ count? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's explain why some are incorrect while one is correct
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The number of bitstrings of length $n$ in which the first bit is 0 or the last bit is 1. \\
	      Surprisingly, it makes sense
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item The number of bitstrings of length $n$ in which the first bit is 0: $ 2^{n-1} $
		      \item The number of bitstrings of length $n$ in which the last bit is 1: $ 2^{n-1} $
		      \item The number of bitstrings of length $n$ in which the first bit is 0 and the last bit is 1: $ 2^{n-2} $
	      \end{enumerate}
	      Adding them up, we get $ 2^{n-1} + 2^{n-1} - 2^{n-2} = 2^{n} - 2^{n-2} $
	\item The number of bitstrings of length $n$ in which the first bit is 0 and the last bit is 1. \\
	      This one is just $ 2^{n-2} $
	\item The number of bitstrings of length $n$ in which the first bit is equal to the last bit. \\
	      The first bit can be anything: 2 \\
	      The second bit can be anything: 2 \\
	      \ldots \\
	      The second last bit can be anything: 2 \\
	      The last bit must be the same as the first bit: 1 \\
	      $ 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot \ldots \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 2^{n-1} $
	\item The number of bitstrings of length $n$ in which the first bit is not equal to the last bit. \\
	      This is basically the same as the third option. The last bit's value is dependent on the first bit's value: $ 2^{n-1} $
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 6}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a group of 100 students. In this group,

63 students like beer,
71 students like cider, and
25 students do not like beer and do not like cider.

How many students like beer and cider? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5), De Morgan's Law (no corresponding chapter) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let B be the event that a student likes beer \\
	      $ |B| = 63 $
	\item Let C be the event that a student likes cider \\
	      $ |C| = 71 $
	\item Let's determine $ \overline{B} \cap \overline{C} $ \\
	      $ | \overline{B} \cap \overline{C} | = 25 $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's determine $ B \cup C $ \\
$ B \cup C = 100 - | \overline{B} \cap \overline{C} | $ \\
$ B \cup C = 100 - 25 $ \\
$ B \cup C = 75 $ \\
Finally, we can determine $ B \cap C $ \\
$ B \cup C = |B| + |C| - |B \cap C| $ \\
$ 75 = 63 + 71 - |B \cap C| $ \\
$ 75 = 134 - |B \cap C| $ \\
$ |B \cap C| = 59 $

\subsection{Question 7}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} In this question, we consider bitstrings of length $n$, where $n$ is an even integer, and in which the positions are numbered $1, 2, \ldots, n$.
For any even integer $n$, let $S_n$ be the number of bitstrings of length $n$ that have both of the following two properties:
There is a 0 at every even position.
The entire bitstring does not contain the substring 101.
Which of the following is true for all even integers $n \geq 6$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } A Recursively Defined Set (4.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's just write down the possible bitstrings and add them up \\
$ 0, 0, S_{n-2} $ \\
$ 1, 0, 0, 0, S_{n-4} $ \\
Adding them up, we get $ S_n = S_{n-2} + S_{n-4} $

\subsection{Question 8}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider bitstrings that contain at least one occurrence of 000. Let $S_n$ be the number of such strings having length $n$. \\
Which of the following is true for $n \geq 4$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } A Recursively Defined Set (4.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Consider the case where the current bit, next bit, and bit after that are all 0 \\
That means we can just calculate the remaining possible bitstring combinations since the requirements have already been met \\
$ 2^{n-3} $ \\
$ 1, S_{n-1} $ \\
$ 0, 1, S_{n-2} $ \\
$ 0, 0, 1, S_{n-3} $ \\
Adding them up, we get $ S_n = S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} + S_{n-3} + 2^{n-3} $

\subsection{Question 10}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We choose, uniformly at random, a string consisting of 14 characters, where each character is a lowercase letter. Let $A$ be the event
$A = $ \enquote{the string contains at least one vowel}.
(A vowel is one of the letters $a, e, i, o$, and $u$.) What is $\Pr(A)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Product Rule (3.1), The Complement Rule (3.3), Uniform Probability Spaces (4.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let S be all possible strings of length 14: $ |S| = 26^{14} $ \\
Let B be the event that the string contains at no vowels \\
The first character can be any of the 21 consonants: 21 \\
The second character can be any of the 21 consonants: 21 \\
\ldots \\
The 14th character can be any of the 21 consonants: 21 \\
$ |B| = 21^{14} $ \\
$ \Pr(B) = \frac{21^{14}}{26^{14}} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = 1 - \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = 1 - \frac{21^{14}}{26^{14}} $

\subsection{Question 11}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a group consisting of 7 girls and 6 boys. Elisa is one of the girls. \\
How many ways are there to arrange these 13 people on a horizontal line such that Elisa has 2 neighbors, both of whom are girls? $ ( $ The order on the line matters. $ ) $ \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Product Rule (3.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
This means there are 13 positions \\
First, select 2 of the girls to be Elisa's neighbors: $ \binom{6}{2} $ \\
Since we're putting 2 girls beside Elisa, girl 1 can be on the left and girl 2 can be on the right OR girl 1 can be on the right and girl 2 can be on the left: 2 \\
As a single entity, the 3 girls can be placed, starting from position 0 to position 10: 11 \\
The remaining 10 people can be placed in the remaining 10 positions: 10! \\
$ \binom{6}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot 11 \cdot 10! $ \\
$ = \frac{6!}{2!4!} \cdot 2 \cdot 11 \cdot 10! $ \\
$ = \frac{6!}{4!} \cdot 11 \cdot 10! $ \\
$ = \frac{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4!}{4!} \cdot 11 \cdot 10! $ \\
$ = \frac{6 \cdot 5}{1} \cdot 11 \cdot 10! $ \\
$ = 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 11 \cdot 10! $

\subsection{Question 12}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $X = {1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10}$. We choose, uniformly at random, a subset $Y$ of $X$, where $Y$ has size 5. Define the events
$A = $ \enquote{1 is an element of $Y$},
$B = $ \enquote{7 is an element of $Y$}.
What is $\Pr(A|B)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), Conditional Probability (5.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be all possible subsets of size 5: $ |S| = \binom{10}{5} $
	\item Let's determine A \\
	      First, pick 1: 1 \\
	      Then we pick 4 more numbers from the remaining 9: $ \binom{9}{4} $ \\
	      $ |A| = \binom{9}{4} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{ \binom{9}{4} }{ \binom{10}{5} } = \frac{9!}{5!4!} \div \frac{10!}{5!5!} = \frac{9!}{5!4!} \cdot \frac{5!5!}{10!} = \frac{1}{4!} \cdot \frac{5!}{10} = \frac{1}{1} \cdot \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item Let's determine B \\
	      First, pick 7: 1 \\
	      Then we pick 4 more numbers from the remaining 9: $ \binom{9}{4} $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{9}{4} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{ \binom{9}{4} }{ \binom{10}{5} } = \frac{9!}{5!4!} \div \frac{10!}{5!5!} = \frac{9!}{5!4!} \cdot \frac{5!5!}{10!} = \frac{1}{4!} \cdot \frac{5!}{10} = \frac{1}{1} \cdot \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item Let's determine $ A \cap B $ \\
	      First, pick 1: 1 \\
	      Second, pick 7: 1 \\
	      Then we pick 3 more numbers from the remaining 8: $ \binom{8}{3} $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = \binom{8}{3} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{ \binom{8}{3} }{ \binom{10}{5} } = \frac{8!}{5!3!} \div \frac{10!}{5!5!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} \cdot \frac{5!5!}{10!} = \frac{8!}{3!} \cdot \frac{5!}{10!} = \frac{1}{3!} \cdot \frac{5!}{10 \cdot 9} = \frac{1}{1} \cdot \frac{5 \cdot 4}{10 \cdot 9} = \frac{5 \cdot 2}{5 \cdot 9} = \frac{2}{9} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{ \Pr(A \cap B) }{ \Pr(B) } $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{ \frac{2}{9} }{ \frac{1}{2} } $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{2}{9} \cdot \frac{2}{1} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{4}{9} $

\subsection{Question 13}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} We flip a fair coin, independently, five times. Define the events
$A = $ \enquote{the coin comes up heads exactly four times},
$B = $ \enquote{the fifth coin flip results in heads}.
What is $\Pr(A|B)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Independent events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be all possible outcomes of the coin flips: $ |S| = 2^5 = 32 $
	\item Let's determine B \\
	      There is a fifth coin flip is heads: 1 \\
	      The other 4 coin flips can be any combination of heads and tails: $ 2^4 = 16 $ \\
	      $ |B| = 16 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{16}{32} = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item Let's determine $ A \cap B $ \\
	      Since the fifth coin flip results in heads, we choose 1 tails for one of the first 4 coin flips: 4 \\
	      $ | B \cap A | = 4 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{4}{32} = \frac{1}{8} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{ \Pr(A \cap B) }{ \Pr(B) } $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{ \frac{1}{8} }{ \frac{1}{2} } $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{2}{1} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{1}{4} $

\subsection{Question 14}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 3$ be an integer. Consider a uniformly random permutation $a_1a_2 \ldots a_n$ of the set ${1, 2, \ldots, n}$. Define the events
$A = $ \enquote{$a_n = n$},
$B = $ \enquote{$a_2 > a_1$}.
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Independent Events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be all possible permutations: $ |S| = n! $
	\item Let's determine A \\
	      $a_n = 1$ is fixed \\
	      The other n-1 numbers can be placed in any order: $ (n-1)! $ \\
	      $ |A| = (n-1)! $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{(n-1)!}{n!} = \frac{(n-1)!}{n \cdot (n-1)!} = \frac{1}{n} $
	\item Let's determine B \\
	      First, we pick 2 numbers to be $a_1$ and $a_2$: $ \binom{n}{2} $ \\
	      The other n-2 numbers can be placed in any order: $ (n-2)! $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{n}{2} \cdot (n-2)! $ \\
	      $ |B| = \frac{n!}{2! (n-2)!} \cdot (n-2)! $ \\
	      $ |B| = \frac{n!}{2!} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{n!}{2! \cdot n!} = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item Let's determine $ A \cap B $ \\
	      $a_n$ is set to $n$: 1 \\
	      We choose 2 numbers to be $a_1$ and $a_2$: $ \binom{n-1}{2} $ \\
	      The other n-3 numbers can be placed in any order: $ (n-3)! $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = \binom{n-1}{2} \cdot (n-3)! $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = \frac{(n-1)!}{2! (n-3)!} \cdot (n-3)! $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = \frac{(n-1)!}{2!} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{(n-1)!}{2 \cdot n!} = \frac{1}{2n} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's check for independence \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{2n} = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{2n} = \frac{1}{2n} $ \\
Since the equation is true, A and B are independent

\subsection{Question 15}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 5$ be an integer. Consider a uniformly random permutation $a_1a_2 \ldots a_n$ of the set ${1, 2, \ldots, n}$. Define the events
$A = $ \enquote{$a_1 = 1$},
$B = $ \enquote{$a_n = 5$}.
What is $\Pr(A \cup B)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Basic Rules of Probability (5.3), The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's determine A \\
	      The probability that $a_1 = 1$ is $ \frac{1}{n} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{1}{n} $
	\item Let's determine B \\
	      The probability that $a_n = 5$ is $ \frac{1}{n} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{1}{n} $
	\item Let's determine $ A \cap B $ \\
	      The probability that both $a_1 = 1$ and $a_n = 5$ is $ \frac{1}{n^2} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{n^2} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) - \Pr(A \cap B) $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cup B) = \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n} \frac{1}{n-1} $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cup B) = \frac{2}{n} - \frac{1}{n(n-1)} $

\subsection{Question 16}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $A$ and $B$ be two events in some sample space. You are given that
$\Pr(A|B) = \Pr(B|A)$,
$\Pr(A \cup B) = 1$,
$\Pr(A \cap B) > 0$.
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's make some statements and see what we can get \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)} $ \\
$ \Pr(B|A) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(A)} $ \\
$ \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(A)} = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) - \Pr(A \cap B) = 1 $ \\
$ 2\Pr(A) - \Pr(A \cap B) = 1 $ \\
For the above statement to be true, $ \Pr(A) > \frac{1}{2} $ because $ \Pr(A \cap B) > 0 $ \\
To illustrate, let's use some values \\
$ \Pr(A) = 0.5 $ and $ \Pr(A \cap B) = 0.25 $ \\
$ 2 \cdot 0.5 - 0.25 = 1 $ \\
$ 1 - 0.25 = 1 $ \\
$ 0.75 = 1 $ \\
As can be seen, $ \Pr(A) > \frac{1}{2} $ needs to be true in order to counter the fact that $ \Pr(A \cap B) > 0 $

\subsection{Question 17}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a uniformly random permutation of the set ${1, 2, \ldots, 50}$. Define the event
$A = $ \enquote{in the permutation, both 8 and 4 are to the left of both 1 and 2}.
What is $\Pr(A)$?
Forget all the other numbers. Let's just focus on 8,4, 1, and 2. How many ways are there to arrange these 4 numbers and how many of them have 8 and 4 to the left of 1 and 2? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Discrete Probability (5) Warning: I can't find a direct chapter section, but question 5.73 from the textbook are very similar \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
For all intents and purposes, the set we really care about is $ |S| = 4! $ \\
We can do $ \{ (1,2), (2,1) \} $ on the left side: 2 \\
We can do $ \{ (8,4), (4,8) \} $ on the right side: 2 \\
$ |A| = 2 \cdot 2 $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{4}{24} = \frac{1}{6} $

\subsection{Question 18}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You roll a fair red die and a fair blue die, independently of each other. Define the random variables
$X = $ \enquote{the result of the red die},
$Y = $ \enquote{the result of the blue die},
$Z = $ min$(X,Y)$.
What is $\Pr(Z=2)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Rolling Two Dice (5.11.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's make a table and identify the minimums and when the occur \\
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c}
		           & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} & \textbf{5} & \textbf{6} \\
		\textbf{1} & 1          & 1          & 1          & 1          & 1          & 1          \\
		\textbf{2} & 1          & 2          & 2          & 2          & 2          & 2          \\
		\textbf{3} & 1          & 2          & 3          & 3          & 3          & 3          \\
		\textbf{4} & 1          & 2          & 3          & 4          & 4          & 4          \\
		\textbf{5} & 1          & 2          & 3          & 4          & 5          & 5          \\
		\textbf{6} & 1          & 2          & 3          & 4          & 5          & 6          \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
As we can see, the minimum of 2 occurs 9 times out of the total 36 possibilities \\
$ \Pr(Z=2) = \frac{9}{36} = \frac{1}{4} $

\subsection{Question 19}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 3$ be an integer and consider a group $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n$ of $n$ people. Each of these people has a uniformly random birthday, which is independent of the birthdays of the other people. We ignore leap years; thus, the year has 365 days.
Define the random variable $X$ to be the number of unordered triples ${P_i, P_j, P_k}$ of people (i.e subsets consisting of three people) that have the same birthday.
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$?
Hint: Use indicator random variables.
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Birthday Paradox (5.5), The Law of Total Probability (5.9) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's check for the probability that 3 people have the same birthday for every subset of 3 people \\
We choose 3 people out of the n people: $ \binom{n}{3} $ \\
The first dude in the subset can have birthday on any day of the year: $ \frac{365}{365} $ \\
The second bro in the subset must have the same birthday as the first dude: $ \frac{1}{365} $ \\
The thid mate in the subset must have the same birthday as the first dude: $ \frac{1}{365} $ \\
The probability that 3 people have the same birthday is $ \frac{1}{365^2} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \binom{n}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{365^2} $

\subsection{Question 20}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a coin that comes up heads with probability $1/5$ and comes up tails with probability $4/5$. \\
You flip this coin twice, independently of each other. For each heads, you win \$100. For each tails, you win \$50. \\
Define the random variable $X$ to be the amount (in dollars) that you win. \\
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Basic Rules of Probability (5.3), Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's calculate the expected value of the each flip \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 100 \cdot \Pr(\text{Heads}) + 50 \cdot \Pr(\text{Tails}) $ \\
$ 100 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 50 \cdot \frac{4}{5} $ \\
$ = 20 + 40 $ \\
$ = 60 $
Since we flip 2 coins, we double the expected value \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 60 \cdot 2 $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 120 $

\subsection{Question 21}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You are given a fair red die and a fair blue die. You roll each die once, independently of each other. Let $(i,j)$ be the outcome, where $i$ is the result of the red die and $j$ is the result of the blue die. Define the random variables
$X = |i-j|$,
and
$Y = \text{max} (i,j)$.
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Independent Events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We don't need to calculate all possibilities. Since this is independence, we're looking for $ \Pr(X=x \cap Y=y) = \Pr(X=x) \cdot \Pr(Y=y) $
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's try $X=5$ \\
	      The only rolls that satisfy this are $ (1,6), (6,1) $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X=5) = \frac{2}{36} = \frac{1}{18} $
	\item Let's try $Y=1$ \\
	      The only rolls that satisfy this are $ (1,1) $ \\
	      $ \Pr(Y=1) = \frac{1}{36} $
	\item $ \Pr(X=5 \cap Y=1) $ \\
	      If the only rolls that satisfy condition 1 are $ (1,6), (6,1) $ and the only rolls that satisfy condition 2 are $ (1,1) $, then there are no rolls that satisfy both conditions \\
	      $ \Pr(X=5 \cap Y=1) = 0 $
\end{enumerate}
Now, check time \\
$ \Pr(X=5 \cap Y=1) = \Pr(X=5) \cdot \Pr(Y=1) $ \\
$ 0 = \frac{1}{18} \cdot \frac{1}{36} $ \\
$ 0 = \frac{1}{648} $ \\
Since the equation is false, there are dependent

\subsection{Question 22}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider the following recursive algorithm $TwoTails$, which takes as input a positive integer $k$. \\
You run algorithm $TwoTails(1)$, i.e., with $k = 1$. Define the random variable $X$ to be the value of the output of this algorithm. \\
Let $m \geq 1$ be an integer. What is $\Pr(X = 2^{m})$? \\
procedure TwoTails$ (k) $ \\
all coin flips made are mutually independent \\
flip a fair coin twice \\
if the coin came up heads exactly twice then \\
return $2^k$ \\
else TwoTails$ (k+1) $ \\
end if \\
end procedure \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Idk, I'll just write down what I see and try to find a pattern \\
We have a 1 in 4 chance of landing 2 heads per double coin flip \\
$ \Pr(X = 1) + \Pr(X = 2) + \Pr(X = 3) + \Pr(X = 4) + \ldots $ \\
$ \frac{1}{4} + (\frac{3}{4})(\frac{1}{4}) + {(\frac{3}{4})}^2 (\frac{1}{4}) + \ldots $ \\
From this, I got the formula $ {(\frac{3}{4})}^{m-1} \cdot \frac{1}{4} $

\subsection{Question 23}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Is the following statement true or false?
For any two random variables $X$ and $Y$, $\mathbb{E}(X \cdot Y) = \mathbb{E}(X) \cdot \mathbb{E}(Y)$.
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Linearity of Expectations (6.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
The answer is that it's cap. Linearity of expectations only works on addition and subtraction. \\
I call cap on multiplication and division

\subsection{Question 24}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Elisa Kazan has successfully completed her first term as President of the Carleton Computer Science Society. \\
In order to celebrate this, Elisa decides to spend an evening in the Hyacintho Cactus Bar and Grill in downtown Ottawa. \\
During this evening, Tan Tran is working as a server. Since Tan has been studying very hard for COMP 2804, he is a bit absent-minded:
Every time a customer orders a drink, Tan serves the wrong drink with probability $1/12$, independently of other orders. \\
Elisa orders 7 ciders, one cider at a time. Let $(D_1, D_2, \ldots, D_7)$ be the sequence of drinks that Tan serves. \\
Define the following random variable $X$:
$X = $ the number of indices $i$ such that $D_i$ is a cider and $D_{i+1}$ is not a cider.
What is the expected value $ \mathbb{E}(X) $ of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Thank God I have a second monitor to watch YouTube videos on \\
Alright, so let's break it down. It's asking for the probability that a $D_i$ is a cider and $D_{i+1}$ is not a cider \\
First has probability of being cider $ \frac{11}{12} $ \\
Second has probability of not being cider $ \frac{1}{12} $ \\
This occurs 6 times. Not 7 because $D_n$ has no $D_{n+1}$ to compare it to \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{6} \frac{11}{12} \cdot \frac{1}{12} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 6 \cdot \frac{11}{12} \cdot \frac{1}{12} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 6 \cdot \frac{11}{144} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{6}{144} $

\subsection{Question 1}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings of length 70, in which each character is one of the letters $a, b, c$. \\
How many such strings have exactly 1 letter $c$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), The Product Rule (3.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
First, we choose the position of the letter $c$: $ \binom{70}{1} = 70$ \\
Then, we choose the positions of the letters $a$ and $b$ for th remaining 69 positions: $ 2^{69} $ \\
$ |C| = 70 \cdot 2^{69} $

\subsection{Question 2}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings of length 70, in which each character is one of the letters $a, b, c$. \\
How many such strings have exactly 12 letters $c$ and exactly 30 letters $b$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Product Rule (3.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Well, we first choose 12 positions out of the 70 for the letter $c$: $ \binom{70}{12} $ \\
Then, we choose 30 positions out of the remaining 58 for the letter $b$: $ \binom{58}{30} $ \\
The remaining 28 positions are for the letter $a$: 1 \\
$ |C| = \binom{70}{12} \cdot \binom{58}{30} $

\subsection{Question 3}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings of length 70, in which each character is one of the letters $a, b, c$. \\
How many such strings have exactly 12 letters $c$ or exactly 30 letters $b$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Product Rule (3.1), Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let C be the event that the string has exactly 12 letters $c$ \\
	      First, we choose 12 positions out of the 70 for the letter $c$: $ \binom{70}{12} $ \\
	      Then, we choose the positions of the letters $a$ and $b$ for the remaining 58 positions: $ 2^{58} $ \\
	      $ |C| = \binom{70}{12} \cdot 2^{58} $
	\item Let B be the event that the string has exactly 30 letters $b$ \\
	      First, we choose 30 positions out of the 70 for the letter $b$: $ \binom{70}{30} $ \\
	      Then, we choose the positions of the letters $a$ and $c$ for the remaining 40 positions: $ 2^{40} $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{70}{30} \cdot 2^{40} $
	\item Let's determine $ B \cap C $ \\
	      First, we choose 12 positions out of the 70 for the letter $c$: $ \binom{70}{12} $ \\
	      Then, we choose 30 positions out of the remaining 58 for the letter $b$: $ \binom{58}{30} $ \\
	      The remaining 28 positions are for the letter $a$: 1 \\
	      $ |B \cap C| = \binom{70}{12} \cdot \binom{58}{30} $
\end{enumerate}
$ |B \cup C| = |B| + |C| - |B \cap C| $ \\
$ |B \cup C| = \binom{70}{30} \cdot 2^{40} + \binom{70}{12} \cdot 2^{58} - \binom{70}{12} \cdot \binom{58}{30} $

\subsection{Question 4}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings of length 70, in which each character is one of the letters $a, b, c$. \\
How many such strings have at least 3 letters $c$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Bitstrings of Length $n$ (3.1.1), Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Complement Rule () \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be all possible strings of length 70: $ |S| = 3^{70} $
	\item Let A be the event that the string has no letters $c$ \\
	      The number of strings with no letters $c$ is $2^{70}$ \\
	      $ |A| = 2^{70} $
	\item Let B be the event that the string has exactly 1 letter $c$ \\
	      First, we choose the position of the letter $c$: $ \binom{70}{1} = 70$ \\
	      Then, we choose the positions of the letters $a$ and $b$ for the remaining 69 positions: $ 2^{69} $ \\
	      $ |B| = 70 \cdot 2^{69} $
	\item Let C be the event that the string has exactly 2 letters $c$ \\
	      First, we choose 2 positions out of the 70 for the letter $c$: $ \binom{70}{2} $ \\
	      Then, we choose the positions of the letters $a$ and $b$ for the remaining 68 positions: $ 2^{68} $ \\
	      $ |C| = \binom{70}{2} \cdot 2^{68} $
\end{enumerate}
$ |A \cup B \cup C| = |S| - |A| - |B| - |C| $ \\
$ |A \cup B \cup C| = 3^{70} - 2^{70} - 70 \cdot 2^{69} - \binom{70}{2} \cdot 2^{68} $

\subsection{Question 5}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer and consider the set $S = {1, 2, \ldots, n}$. \\
What does $\sum_{k=2}^{n} \binom{n}{k}$ count? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's break down which ones are right and which ones are wrong
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The number of subsets of $S$ that are non-empty. \\
	      This phrase takes into account subsets of size 1 but the equation starts at 2. This is wrong.
	\item The number of subsets of $S$ that contain at least two elements. \\
	      So this one looks right. We start off at subsets of size at least 2 and go all the way up to subsets of size $n$. This is correct.
	\item The number of bitstrings of length $n$ that contain at least one 0. \\
	      So this one is wrong because it doesn't contain bitstrings that contain one 0
	\item The number of bitstrings of length $n$ that contain at least three 0's. \\
	      This one is wrong because it doesn't contain bitstrings that contain at two 0's
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 6}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} What is the coefficient of $x^{20}y^{35}$ in the expansion of ${(5x - 3y)}^{55}$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Newton’s Binomial Theorem (3.6.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$ = \sum_{k = 35}^{55} \binom{55}{k} {(5x)}^{k} {(-3y)}^{n-k} $ \\
$ = \binom{55}{20} {(5x)}^{20} {(-3y)}^{35} $ \\
$ = - \binom{55}{20} 5^{20} 3^{35} x^{20} y^{35}$ \\
The coefficient is $ - \binom{55}{20} 5^{20} 3^{35} $

\subsection{Question 7}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A string that is obtained by rearranging the letters of the word $\text{SUCCESS}$ is called awesome, if the string contains the substring UE or EU; Thus, both SCUESCS and SCSEUCS are awesome, whereas SUCCESS is not awesome. What is the number of awesome strings? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Reordering the Letters of a Word (3.9.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
First, we take a E and a U and treat them as a single entity, so the conditions are met \\
Since the entity can be either EU or UE, there are double the possibilities: 2 \\
We now act as if we only have 6 entitieS. \\
There are 6 possible positions for the EU/UE to go: 6 \\
For the 3 $S$'s, we choose 3 positions out of the 5: $ \binom{5}{3} $ \\
For the 2 $C$'s, we choose 2 positions out of the 2: $ \binom{2}{2} = 1 $ \\
$ 2 \cdot 6 \cdot \binom{5}{3} $ \\
$ = 2 \cdot 6 \cdot \frac{5!}{3!2!} $ \\
$ = 2 \cdot 6 \cdot \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} $ \\
$ = 2 \cdot 6 \cdot 10 $ \\
$ = 2 \cdot 60 $ \\
$ = 120 $

\subsection{Question 8}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 1$ be an integer and let $S_n$ be the number of ways in which $n$ can be written as a sum of 2's and 4's; the order in which the 2's and 4's occur in the sum matters. \\
For example, $S_6 = 3$, because $6 = 2 + 2 + 2 = 2 + 4 = 4 + 2$.
Which of the following is true for any integer $n \geq 6$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } A Recursively Defined Set (4.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's write out the possibilities and sum them \\
$2, S_{n-2} $ \\
$4, S_{n-4} $ \\
The reason this works is because it's as if we have n balls. We have baskets that can store 2 balls and baskets that can store 4 balls. \\
We can choose to put 2 balls in the 2-ball basket or in the 4-ball basket \\
Every time we use one of the baskets, we subtract by that number of balls \\
$ S_n = S_{n-2} + S_{n-4} $

\subsection{Question 9}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider bitstrings that do not contain 110. Let $S_n$ be the number of such strings having length $n$. \\
Which of the following is true for any $n \geq 4$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } A Recursively Defined Set (4.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's write out the possibilities and sum them \\
$ 0, S_{n-1} $ \\
$ 1, 0, S_{n-2} $ \\
We also have to consider the possibility of having all 1's, which isn't considered in the above possibilities \\
$ S_n = S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} + 1 $

\subsection{Question 10}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} The function $T: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ is recursively defined as follows:
$T(0) = 2$,
$T(n) = 3 \cdot T(n-1) + 1$, if $n \geq 1$.
Which of the following is true for all integers $n \geq 0$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Recursive Functions (4.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's calculate $ T(1) $ \\
$ T(1) = 3 \cdot f(0) + 1 = 3 \cdot 2 + 1 = 7 $
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ T(n) = \frac{5}{2} \cdot 3^{n} - 1 $ \\
	      $ T(1) = \frac{5}{2} \cdot 3^{1} - 1 = \frac{5}{2} \cdot 3 - 1 = \frac{15}{2} - 1 = \frac{13}{2} $
	\item $ T(n) = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 3^{n} - \frac{1}{2} $ \\
	      $ T(1) = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 3^{1} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 3 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{9}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 4 $
	\item $ T(n) = \frac{5}{2} \cdot 3^{n} - \frac{1}{2} $ \\
	      $ T(1) = \frac{5}{2} \cdot 3^{1} - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \cdot 3 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{15}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 7 $
	\item None of the above
\end{enumerate}
We did it, everyone. The answer is C.

\subsection{Question 11}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You flip a fair coin 5 times; the flips are independent of each other. \\
What is the probability that in these 5 coin flips, the coin comes up heads an odd number of times? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Recursive Functions (4.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Okay, there are two ways to go about this
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The first is to realize that the chance the coin comes up a certain face an odd or even number of times is straight up $ \frac{1}{2} $ \\
	      Screw drawing out the whole 5-level deep recursive tree. We can just draw out a 3-level deep tree \\
	      \begin{forest}
		      [
			      [H
						      [H
								      [H]
								      [T]
						      ]
						      [T
								      [H]
								      [T]
						      ]
				      ]
				      [T
						      [H
								      [H]
								      [T]
						      ]
						      [T[
									      H]
								      [T]
						      ]
				      ]
		      ]
	      \end{forest} \\
	      If you notice, our first flip gets us a head or a tail, which is a 50/50 chance. \\
	      The first flip doubles the possibilities \\
	      If after flipping a heads we flip a heads again, this creates an even number of tails BUT the probability is kept the same by the fact that another possibility is HT \\
	      If after flipping a tails we flip a tails, it's even BUT the counter is that we could land a TH, which brings the probability back to 50/50 \\
	      Ever time we flip the coin to get an odd number of heads, we could just as easily have gotten an even number of tails \\
	      Some of the exam questions are like this, and it's not really worth the time to brute force calculate \\
	      It's as intuitive as it is unintuitive
	\item Second, we can draw out a tree and realize that the probability of getting an odd number of heads is the same as getting an even number of heads
	\item  Third, let's just waste brainpower to solve this
	      \begin{enumerate}
		      \item Let S be all possible outcomes of the coin flips: $ |S| = 2^5 = 32 $
		      \item Let A represent the event that the coin comes up heads once \\
		            We choose 1 position out of the 5 for the head: $ \binom{5}{1} $ \\
		            The remaining 4 positions are for the tails: 1 \\
		            $ |A| = \binom{5}{1} $
		      \item Let B represent the event that the coin comes up heads 3 times \\
		            We choose 3 positions out of the 5 for the heads: $ \binom{5}{3} $ \\
		            The remaining 2 positions are for the tails: 1 \\
		            $ |B| = \binom{5}{3} $
		      \item Let C represent the event that the coin comes up heads 5 times \\
		            We choose 5 positions out of the 5 for the heads: $ \binom{5}{5} $ \\
		            The remaining 0 positions are for the tails: 1 \\
		            $ |C| = \binom{5}{5} $
	      \end{enumerate}
	      $ \Pr(\text{odd number of heads}) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) + \Pr(C) $ \\
	      $ \Pr(\text{odd number of heads}) = \frac{ \binom{5}{1} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{5} }{32} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(\text{odd number of heads}) = \frac{5 + 10 + 1}{32} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(\text{odd number of heads}) = \frac{16}{32} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(\text{odd number of heads}) = \frac{1}{2} $
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 12}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} In a standard deck of 52 cards, each card has a suit and a rank. \\
There are four suits (spades $ \spadesuit $, hearts $ \heartsuit $, clubs $ \clubsuit $, and diamonds $ \diamondsuit $), and 13 ranks (Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King). \\
Assume you get a uniformly random hand consisting of 5 cards. What is the probability that the 5 cards in this hand are all of the same suit? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Probability of Getting a Full House (5.4.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
So there are 13  (spades $ \spadesuit $ cards, 13 hearts $ \heartsuit $ cards, 13 clubs $ \clubsuit $ cards, and 13 diamonds $ \diamondsuit $) cards
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be all possible hands of 5 cards: $ |S| = \binom{52}{5} $
	\item Let A be the event that the 5 cards are all of the same suit \\
	      First, we choose 1 of the 4 suits for the hand: $ \binom{4}{1} = 4 $ \\
	      Then from any of these 13 card suits, we choose 5 cards: $ \binom{13}{5} $ \\
	      $ |A| = 4 \cdot \binom{13}{5} $
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{ 4 \cdot \binom{13}{5} }{ \binom{52}{5} } $
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Question 13}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You are given a fair die that has six faces. One face has the letter $a$ on it, two faces have the letter $b$ on them, and three faces have the letter $c$ on them. Assume you roll this die twice, independently of each other. Define the events
$A = $ \enquote{both rolls result in the same letter},
$B = $ \enquote{at least one of the two rolls results in the letter $a$}.
What is $\Pr(A|B)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Rolling Two Dice (5.11.1), Conditional Probability (5.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's determine $ B $ \\
	      What we care about is when we get an $a$ so let's map that out with a table \\
	      \begin{table}[h!]

$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{ \frac{1}{36} }{ \frac{11}{36} } $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{1}{11} $

\subsection{Question 14}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n$ and $k$ be integers with $1 \leq k \leq n$.
You are given two bitstrings $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$, and $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ of length $n$. \\
In both bitstrings, each bit is 0 with probability $1/2$, and 1 with probability $1/2$ (independent of all other bits).
Consider the bitstring $a_1 \cdot b_1, a_2 \cdot b_2, \ldots, a_n \cdot b_n$, where $a_i \cdot b_i$ is the result of multiplying the two bits $a_i$ and $b_i$. \\
What is the probability that this bitstring contains exactly $k$ many 1s? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Determining the Expected Value (6.7.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's see some products
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ 0 \cdot 0 = 0 $
	\item $ 1 \cdot 0 = 0 $
	\item $ 0 \cdot 1 = 0 $
	\item $ 1 \cdot 1 = 1 $
\end{enumerate}
Let $k$ be the number of 1s in this bitstring. \\
There are n positions and the probability of getting a 1 is $ \frac{1}{4} $ \\
$X \sim \text{Binomial}(n, 1/4)$ \\
$ \Pr(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} {\left( \frac{1}{4} \right)}^{k} {\left( \frac{3}{4} \right)}^{n-k} $ \\
$ \Pr(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} \frac{1^k \cdot 3^{n-k}}{4^n} $ \\
$ \Pr(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} \frac{3^{n-k}}{4^n} $

\subsection{Question 15}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider a uniformly random permutation $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ of the set ${1, 2, 3, 4}$. Define the events
$A = a_1 > a_2 $,
$B = a_4 > a_3 $.
Which of the following is correct? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), The Product Rule (3.1), Independent Events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
I have a gut feeling that they're independent, but let's check
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be all possible permutations of the set ${1, 2, 3, 4}$: $ |S| = 4! = 24 $
	\item Let's determine A \\

\subsection{Question 16}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You flip a fair coin three times; these three flips are independent. Define the events
$A = $ \enquote{the number of heads in these three flips is even},
$B = $ \enquote{the number of tails in these three flips is at most one}.
(Remember that 0 is even.) Which of the following is correct? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Independent Evening (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's determine $ A $ \\
	      As discussed in the solution to question 11, the probability of getting an even number of heads is the same as getting an odd number of heads \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item Let's determine $ B $ \\
	      We choose 0 tails out of the 3 flips: $ \binom{3}{0} = 1 $ \\
	      We choose 1 tail out of the 3 flips: $ \binom{3}{1} = 3 $ \\
	      $ |B| = 1 + 3 = 4 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item Let's determine $ A \cap B $ \\
	      We need an even number of heads at at most 1 tail \\
	      In the case of 0 tails, we have 3 heads, which means an odd number of heads: 0 \\
	      In the case of 1 tail, we have 2 heads, which means an even number of heads \\
	      We choose 1 tail out of the 3 flips: $ \binom{3}{1} = 3 $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 3 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{3}{8} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's check whether they're independent \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{3}{8} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ \frac{3}{8} = \frac{1}{4} $ \\

\subsection{Question 17}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $A$ and $B$ be two independent events in some sample space $S$. \\
You are given that $\Pr(A) = 1/4$ and $\Pr(B) = 2/3$. What is $\Pr(A \cup B)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } The Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5), Independent Events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
The equation is $ \Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) - \Pr(A \cap B) $ \\
Since they're independent, $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3} $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{2}{12} $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{6} $ \\
Now, we can find $ \Pr(A \cup B) $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) - \Pr(A \cap B) $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cup B) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{2}{3} - \frac{1}{6} $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cup B) = \frac{3}{12} + \frac{8}{12} - \frac{2}{12} $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cup B) = \frac{9}{12} $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cup B) = \frac{3}{4} $

\subsection{Question 18}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A red box contains the numbers 0, 1, and 2, and a blue box also contains the numbers 0, 1, and 2. You choose a uniformly random element from the red box and a uniformly random element from the blue box; these two choices are independent of each other. Define the random variables
$X = $ the number you choose from the red box,
$Y = $ the number you choose from the blue box,
$Z = \text{max}(X,Y)$.
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(Z)$ of the random variable $Z$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Brute force it with all posibilities \\
$ \{ (00), (01), (02), (10), (11), (12), (20), (21), (22) \} $ \\
So straight up, there are 9 possibilities and the probability of each ordered pair has a chance of occuring with $ \frac{1}{9} $ \\
In the order that the orered pairs appear above, I'm gonna write down the max of each pair along with the probability of that pair occuring \\
$ \frac{1}{9} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{9} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{9} \cdot 2 + \frac{1}{9} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{9} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{9} \cdot 2 + \frac{1}{9} \cdot 2 + \frac{1}{9} \cdot 2 + \frac{1}{9} \cdot 2 $ \\
$ = \frac{1}{9} ( 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 ) $ \\
$ = \frac{1}{9} ( 13 ) $ \\
$ = \frac{13}{9} $

\subsection{Question 19}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. Consider a string $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ of length $n$, in which each character $c_i$ is a uniformly random element of the set ${\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \epsilon}$ (independently of all other characters). \\
Define the random variable $X$ to be the number of indices $i$ with $1 \leq i \leq n$ for which $c_i = c_{i+1}$. \\
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$? \\
Hint: Use indicator random variables. \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if $c_i = c_{i+1}$ and 0 otherwise \\
So $c_i$ can be any of the 5 characters, but $c_{i+1}$ needs to follow after $c_i$. It has a 1 in 5 chance of being the same character: $ \frac{1}{5} $ \\
We do this for every value from 1 to n-1. We exclude n because there is not value that comes after the last value: $ (n-1) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X_1 + X_2 + \text{\ldots} + X_{n-1}) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \mathbb{E}(X_i) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{5} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{n-1}{5} $

\subsection{Question 20}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. You are given $n$ beer bottles $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_n$ and two cider bottles $C_1$ and $C_2$. You choose a uniformly random 3-element subset of the set of these $n+2$ bottles. Define the random variable $X$ to be
$X = $ the number of cider bottles in the chosen subset.
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Permutations and Binomial Coefficients (3.6.1), Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X_i$ be 2 if there are 2 cider bottles in the subset, 1 if there is 1 cider bottle in the subset, and 0 if there are no cider bottles in the subset
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $X_i = 0 $ if there are no cider bottles \\
	      First we choose 3 beer bottles: $ \binom{n}{3} $ \\
	      Second we choose 0 cider bottles: $ \binom{2}{0} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X_i = 0) = \frac{ \binom{n}{3} \cdot \binom{2}{0} }{ \binom{n+2}{3} } $
	\item $X_i = 1 $ if there is 1 cider bottle \\
	      First we choose 1 cider bottle: $ \binom{2}{1} $ \\
	      Second we choose 2 beer bottles: $ \binom{n}{2} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{ \binom{2}{1} \cdot \binom{n}{2} }{ \binom{n+2}{3} } $
	\item $X_i = 2 $ if there are 2 cider bottles \\
	      First we choose 2 cider bottles: $ \binom{2}{2} $ \\
	      Second we choose 1 beer bottle: $ \binom{n}{1} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(X_i = 2) = \frac{ \binom{2}{2} \cdot \binom{n}{1} }{ \binom{n+2}{3} } $
\end{enumerate}
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 0 \cdot \Pr(X_i = 0) + 1 \cdot \Pr(X_i = 1) + 2 \cdot \Pr(X_i = 2) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 0 \cdot \frac{ \binom{n}{3} \cdot \binom{2}{0} }{ \binom{n+2}{3} } + 1 \cdot \frac{ \binom{2}{1} \cdot \binom{n}{2} }{ \binom{n+2}{3} } + 2 \cdot \frac{ \binom{2}{2} \cdot \binom{n}{1} }{ \binom{n+2}{3} } $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{ \binom{2}{1} \cdot \binom{n}{2} }{ \binom{n+2}{3} } + 2 \cdot \frac{ \binom{2}{2} \cdot \binom{n}{1} }{ \binom{n+2}{3} } $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2} + 2 \cdot \binom{n}{1} }{ \binom{n+2}{3} } $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2} + 2 \cdot n }{ \binom{n+2}{3} } $

\subsection{Question 21}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You are given two independent random variables $X$ and $Y$, where
$\Pr(X=0) = \Pr(X=1) = \Pr(Y=0) = \Pr(Y=1) = 1/2$.
Define the random variable
$Z = (X+Y) \text{ mod } 2$.
Which of the following is correct? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Linearity of Expectations (6.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Linearity of Expectations allows this to exist without crushing it; therefore, independent

\subsection{Question 22}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Zoltan's Noodle House is a popular restaurant in downtown Ottawa. \\
When you order the surprise dish, you get Mi Quang with probability $1/4$, Bun Cha Ca with probability $1/3$, and Banh Xeo with probability $5/12$. \\
Tri enjoys going to this restaurant, because the food reminds him of his mommy's food back home in Da Nang. \\
Tri runs the following recurisve algorithm. Define the random variable $X$ to be the number of dishes that Tri eats when running algorithm $TrisIsHungry$. \\
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$? \\
procedure TrisIsHungry$ () $ \\
the results of all orders are independent \\
Tri orders the surprise dish \\
if Tri gets Mi Quang then \\
Tri eats the dish \\
TrisIsHungry$ () $ \\
else if Tri gets Bun Cha Ca then \\
Tri eats the dish \\
TrisIsHungry$ () $ \\
else if Tri gets Banh Xeo then \\
Tri eats the dish \\
Tri pays the bill and goes home \\
end if \\
end procedure \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Determining the Expected Value (6.6.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We're looking for the number of times Tri eats when running the algorithm, which is akin to saying \enquote{how many times do we call TriIsHungry?} \\
The probability that we call TriIsHungry again is $ \frac{5}{12} $ since we only stop when we get Banh Xeo \\
Geometric Distrbution tells us that the expected number of times until something happens is $ \frac{1}{\Pr} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{12}} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{12}{5} $

\subsection{Question 23}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} The final exam for COMP 2804 has 25 multiple-choice questions. \\
For each question, there are 4 possible answers, exactly one of which is correct. \\
Michiel chooses a positive real number $z$ and uses the following marking scheme: For each correct answer, a student receives 1 mark, whereas for each incorrect answer, the student receives $-z$ marks. \\
Jim is one of the students and answers the 25 questions, by choosing a uniformly random answer for each question; the choices are independent of each other. \\
Define the random variable
$X = $ the number of marks that Jim receives.
For what value of $z$ is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ equal to 0? \\
Hint: Use the Linearity of Expectation. \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Linearity of Expectation (6.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Alright. So let's just linear algebra the hell outta this question \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if the student gets the question right and -z if the student gets the question wrong
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $X_i = 1$ if the student gets the question right \\
	      $ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{4} $
	\item $X_i = -z$ if the student gets the question wrong \\
	      $ \Pr(X_i = -z) = \frac{3}{4} $
\end{enumerate}
$ 0 = \sum_{k=1}^{25} ( 1 \cdot \Pr(X_i = 1) ) + \sum_{k=1}^{25} ( -z \cdot \Pr(X_i = -z) ) $ \\
$ 0 = \sum_{k=1}^{25} ( 1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} ) + \sum_{k=1}^{25} ( -z \cdot \frac{3}{4} ) $ \\
$ 0 = 25 \cdot ( 1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} ) + 25(-z \cdot \frac{3}{4}) $ \\
$ 0 = 25 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 25z \cdot \frac{3}{4} $ \\
$ 0 = \frac{25}{4} - \frac{75z}{4} $ \\
$ 0 = 25 - 75z $ \\
$ 75z = 25 $ \\
$ z = \frac{25}{75} $ \\
$ z = \frac{1}{3} $

\subsection{Question 24}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. There are $n$ students $S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n$ writing this exam. \\
Each student has brought one backpack with them. Before the exam starts, all students have to leave their backpacks at the front of the examination room. \\
At the end of the exam, the proctor places the backpacks in a uniformly random order $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$, and, for each $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, gives backpack $b_i$ to student $S_i$. \\
Define the following random variable $X$:
$X = $ the number of students who get their own backpack.
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$? \\
Hint: Use indicator random variables. \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Indicator Random Variables (6.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if student $S_i$ gets their own backpack and 0 otherwise \\
$ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{n} $ \\
Now, we do this for every student
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \mathbb{E}(X_1 + X_2 + \text{\ldots} + X_n) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \mathbb{E}(X_i) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{n} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{n}{n} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 1 $

\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
You are given 20 beer bottles $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_{20}$ and 50 cider bottles $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_{50}$. Consider subsets of these 70 bottles, consisting of 30 bottles, exactly 12 of which are beer bottles. How many subsets are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Product Rule (3.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
Let's choose 12 beer bottles out of the 20: $ \binom{20}{12} $ \\
Let's choose 18 cider bottles out of the 50: $ \binom{50}{18} $ \\
$ \binom{20}{12} \cdot \binom{50}{18} $

\subsection{Question 2}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
You are given 20 beer bottles $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_{20}$ and 50 cider bottles $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_{50}$. Consider subsets of these 70 bottles, that contain exactly 12 beer bottles (and any number of cider bottles) or exactly 12 cider bottles (and any number of beer bottles). How many such subsets are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Product Rule (3.1), Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let B be the set with exactly 12 beer bottles and any number of cider bottles \\
	      First, choose 12 beer bottles out of the 20: $ \binom{20}{12} $ \\
	      We need to take into account all subsets of cider bottles that we add to the 12 beer bottles: $ 2^{50} $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{20}{12} \cdot 2^{50} $
	\item Let C be the set with exactly 12 cider bottles and any number of beer bottles \\
	      First, choose 12 cider bottles out of the 50: $ \binom{50}{12} $ \\
	      We need to take into account all subsets of beer bottles that we add to the 12 cider bottles: $ 2^{20} $ \\
	      $ |C| = \binom{50}{12} \cdot 2^{20} $
	\item Let's determine $ B \cap C $: the set with exactly 12 beer bottles and 12 cider bottles \\
	      We need to choose 12 beer bottles and 12 cider bottles \\
	      First, choose 12 beer bottles out of the 20: $ \binom{20}{12} $ \\
	      First, choose 12 cider bottles out of the 50: $ \binom{50}{12} $ \\
	      $ |B \cap C| = \binom{20}{12} \cdot \binom{50}{12} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, we can find $ B \cup C $ \\
$ |B \cup C| = |B| + |C| - |B \cap C| $ \\
$ |B \cup C| = \binom{20}{12} \cdot 2^{50} + \binom{50}{12} \cdot 2^{20} - \binom{20}{12} \cdot \binom{50}{12} $

\subsection{Question 3}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
You are given 20 beer bottles $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_{20}$ and 50 cider bottles $C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_{50}$. Consider subsets of these 70 bottles, that contain at least 3 beer bottles (and any number of cider bottles). How many such subsets are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Product Rule (3.1), Complement Rule (3.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A be the set of all bottles that contain 0 beer bottles \\
	      First, choose 0 beer bottles out of the 20: $ \binom{20}{0} $ \\
	      We need to take into account all subsets of cider bottles that we add to the 0 beer bottles: $ 2^{50} $ \\
	      $ |A| = \binom{20}{0} \cdot 2^{50} $
	\item Let B be the set of all bottles that contain 1 beer bottle \\
	      First, choose 1 beer bottle out of the 20: $ \binom{20}{1} $ \\
	      We need to take into account all subsets of cider bottles that we add to the 1 beer bottle: $ 2^{50} $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{20}{1} \cdot 2^{50} $
	\item Let C be the set of all bottles that contain 2 beer bottles \\
	      First, choose 2 beer bottles out of the 20: $ \binom{20}{2} $ \\
	      We need to take into account all subsets of cider bottles that we add to the 2 beer bottles: $ 2^{50} $ \\
	      $ |C| = \binom{20}{2} \cdot 2^{50} $
\end{enumerate}
Since the question is asking for all possibilities excluding 0, 1, and 2 beer bottles, we can find the total number of possibilities by subtracting the number of possibilities that contain 0, 1, and 2 beer bottles from the total number of possibilities \\
Let D be the set of all bottles that contain at least 3 beer bottles \\
$ |D| = 2^{70} - |A| - |B| - |C| $ \\
$ |D| = 2^{70} - \binom{20}{0} \cdot 2^{50} - \binom{20}{1} \cdot 2^{50} - \binom{20}{2} \cdot 2^{50} $ \\
$ |D| = 2^{70} - 2^{50} - 20 \cdot 2^{50} - \binom{20}{2} \cdot 2^{50} $

\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
Consider strings consisting of 40 characters, where each character is an element of ${a, b, c, d}$. How many such strings contain exactly five $a$'s or exactly 5 $c$'s? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Product Rule (3.1), Counting Bitstrings of Length n (3.1.1), Principle of Inclusion and Exclusion (3.5) \\
\textbf{Explanation:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A be the set of all strings that contain exactly 5 $a$'s \\
	      First, choose 5 positions out of the 40 for the $a$'s: $ \binom{40}{5} $ \\
	      Then for the remaining characters in the strings, they can be either $b$, $c$ or $d$ = $ 3^{35} $ \\
	      $ |A| = \binom{40}{5} \cdot 3^{35} $
	\item Let B be the set of all strings that contain exactly 5 $c$'s \\
	      First, choose 5 positions out of the 40 for the $c$'s: $ \binom{40}{5} $ \\
	      Then for the remaining characters in the strings, they can be either $a$, $b$ or $d$ = $ 3^{35} $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{40}{5} \cdot 3^{35} $
	\item Let's determine $ A \cap B $ \\
	      We need to choose 5 positions out of the 40 for the $a$'s and the $c$'s: $ \binom{40}{5} $ \\
	      We need to choose 5 positions out of the remaining 35 for the $c$'s: $ \binom{35}{5} $ \\
	      Then for the remaining characters in the strings, they can be either $b$ or $d$ = $ 2^{30} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, we can find $ A \cup B $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = \binom{40}{5} \cdot 3^{35} + \binom{40}{5} \cdot 3^{35} - \binom{40}{5} \cdot \binom{35}{5} \cdot 2^{30} $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = 2 \cdot \binom{40}{5} \cdot 3^{35} - \binom{40}{5} \cdot \binom{35}{5} \cdot 2^{30} $

\subsection{Question 5}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
Let $m \geq 2$ and $n \geq 2$ be integers. What does $\binom{m}{2} + \binom{n}{2} + m \cdot n$ count? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Sum Rule (3.4), Combinatorial Proof (3.7) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
The answer is C, and I will show how the expression in the question shows the number of ways to choose a 2-element subset from a set consisting of m + n elements: \\
From a set of $m + n$ elements, we can form 2-element subsets in 3 different ways:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Choose 2 elements from the $m$ set: there are $\binom{m}{2}$ ways to do this
	\item Choose 2 elements from the $n$ set: there are $\binom{n}{2}$ ways to do this
	\item Choose 1 element from the $m$ set and 1 element from the $n$ set: there are $\binom{m}{1} \cdot \binom{n}{1} = m \cdot n$
\end{enumerate}
Now, if we apply the Sum Rule to all of these cases above, we get $\binom{m}{2} + \binom{n}{2} + m \cdot n$, which matches the expression above.

\subsection{Question 6}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
Nick eats a lot of bananas. During a period of 7 days, Nick eats a total of 25 bananas. A banana schedule is a sequence of 7 numbers, whose sum is equal to 25, and whose numbers indicate the number of bananas that Nick eats on each day. Three examples of such schedules are $(3, 2, 7, 4, 1, 3, 5)$, $(2, 3, 7, 4, 1, 3, 5)$, and $(3, 0, 9, 4, 1, 0, 8)$. How many banana schedules are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Counting Solutions of Linear Equations (3.9.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
We can rephrase this into something more familiar. Let $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7$ be the number of bananas Nick eats on each day. \\
$ x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 = 25 $ \\
This is one of the divider questions \\
Assume we have 25 bananas and 6 dividers. We place the dividers between any set of bananas to indicate how many are eaten between dividers
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $x_1$ is represented as the number of bananas eaten to the left of the first divider
	\item $x_2$ is represented as the number of bananas eaten between the first and second divider
	\item $x_3$ is represented as the number of bananas eaten between the second and third divider
	\item $x_4$ is represented as the number of bananas eaten between the third and fourth divider
	\item $x_5$ is represented as the number of bananas eaten between the fourth and fifth divider
	\item $x_6$ is represented as the number of bananas eaten between the fifth and sixth divider
	\item $x_7$ is represented as the number of bananas eaten to the right of the sixth divider
\end{enumerate}
Since we place dividers down, we need to add 6 dividers to the 25 bananas \\
We choose 6 positions out of the 31 for the dividers: $ \binom{31}{6} $

\subsection{Question 7}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
A string that is obtained by rearranging the letters of the word BOOGER is called awesome, if the string does not contain the substring $OO$. Thus, GEOROB is awesome, whereas GREOOB is not awesome. What is the number of awesome strings? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Complement Rule (3.3), Reordering the Letters of a Word (3.9.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all strings that contain the substring $OO$ \\
	      First, we choose 1 of the 6 positions to place the $B$: $ \binom{6}{1} = 6$ \\
	      Then we choose 2 of the remaining 5 positions to place the $O$'s: $ \binom{5}{2} $ \\
	      Then we choose 1 of the remaining 3 positions to place the $G$: $ \binom{3}{1} = 3$ \\
	      Then we choose 1 of the remaining 2 positions to place the $E$: $ \binom{2}{1} = 2$ \\
	      Then we choose 1 of the remaining 1 positions to place the $R$: $ \binom{1}{1} = 1$ \\
	      $ |S| = 6 \cdot \binom{5}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$
	\item Let $ \overline{A} $ represent the set of all strings where the substring $OO$ is present \\
	      First, we group the O's together and treat them as one entity, meaning we have 5 entities to arrange \\
	      We choose 1 of the 5 positions to place the $B$: $ \binom{5}{1} = 5 $ \\
	      Then we choose 1 of the remaining 4 positions to place the $G$: $ \binom{4}{1} = 4 $ \\
	      Then we choose 1 of the remaining 3 positions to place the $E$: $ \binom{3}{1} = 3 $ \\
	      Then we choose 1 of the remaining 2 positions to place the $R$: $ \binom{2}{1} = 2 $ \\
	      Then we choose 1 of the remaining 1 positions to place the $OO$: $ \binom{1}{1} = 1 $ \\
	      $ |\overline{A}| = 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 5! $
\end{enumerate}
Now, we can find the number of awesome strings \\
$|A| = |S| - |\overline{A}| $ \\
$|A| = (6 \cdot \binom{5}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1) - 5!$ \\
$|A| = (6 \cdot \binom{5}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 2) - 5!$

\subsection{Question 8}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
Consider strings consisting of characters, where each character is an element of ${a, b, c, d}$. Such a string is called valid, if it does not contain $aa$, it does not contain $bb$, it does not contain $cc$, and it does not contain $dd$. For any integer $n \geq 2$, what is the number of valid strings of length $n$?\\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Recursive Functions (4.1), Counting 00-Free Bitstrings (4.2.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
The first character can be any of the 4 characters: 4 \\
The second character can be any of the 3 characters that are not the first character: 3 \\
The third character can be any of the 3 characters that are not the second character: 3 \\
\ldots \\
The nth character can be any of the 3 characters that are not the $(n-1)$th character: 3 \\
$= 4 \cdot 3^{n-1} $

\subsection{Question 9}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
Consider bitstrings that do not contain 110. Let $S_n$ be the number of such strings having length $n$. Which of the following is true for any $n \geq 4$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Recursive Functions (4.1), Counting 00-Free Bitstrings (4.2.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
Let's write out the possibilities and sum them:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ 1, S_{n-1} $ is not allowed since this would mean the recursive call's next value could also be 1, which leads to 11
	\item $ 0, S_{n-1} $
	\item $ 1, 0, S_{n-2} $
\end{enumerate}
Although this takes into account many possibilities, it does not take into a bitstring that is made of all 1's: 1 \\
$ S_n = S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} + 1 $

\subsection{Question 10}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
Consider the recursive algorithm $SundayEveningExam$, which takes as input an integer $n \geq 1$. \\
Let $P(n)$ be the number of times the line "I don't like Sunday evening exams" is printed when running algorithm $SundayEveningExam(n)$. \\
Which of the following is true for all $n \geq 1$?
\begin{verbatim}
procedure SundayEveningExam$ (n) $
if n = 1 then p
print "I don't like Sunday evening exams"
else
for i=1 to n do
print "I don't like Sunday Evening Exams"
end for
SundayEveningExam$ (n-1) $
end if
end procedure
\end{verbatim}
\textbf{Correct Answer:} C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Recursive Functions (4.1), A Gossip Problem (4.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
On SundayEveningExam$ (n) $, the line \enquote{I don't like Sunday evening exams} is printed n times \\
On SundayEveningExam$ (n-1) $, the line \enquote{I don't like Sunday evening exams} is printed n-1 times \\
On SundayEveningExam$ (n-2) $, the line \enquote{I don't like Sunday evening exams} is printed n-2 times \\
\ldots \\
On SundayEveningExam$ (1) $, the line \enquote{I don't like Sunday evening exams} is printed 1 time \\
$ P(n) = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + \text{\ldots} + 1$ \\
Using the 1st Formula given on the Exam Sheet, it translates the above to the following: \\
$ P(n) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} $

\subsection{Question 11}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
You roll a fair die 18 times; the rolls are independent of each other. What is the probability that you roll a 5 exactly three times? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Discrete Probability (5), Basic Rules of Probability (5.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
First, we choose which 3 of the 18 rolls are 5: $ \binom{18}{3} $ \\
We also need to calculate the prbability of rolling a 5 exactly 3 times: ${(\frac{1}{6})}^3 $ \\
We also need to calculate the probability of not rolling a 5 exactly 15 times: ${(\frac{5}{6})}^{15} $ \\
$ \binom{18}{3} \cdot {(\frac{1}{6})}^3 \cdot {(\frac{5}{6})}^{15} $ \\
$ = \binom{18}{3} \cdot (\frac{1^3}{6^3}) \cdot (\frac{5^{15}}{6^{15}}) $ \\
$ = \binom{18}{3} \cdot \frac{5^{15}}{6^{18}} $

\subsection{Question 12}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
A string $s_1s_2\ldots s_n$ is called a palindrome, if $$s_1s_2\ldots s_{n-1}s_n = s_n s_{n-1}\ldots s_2s_1$$,
i.e., reading the string from left to right gives the same result as reading the string from right to left. \\
Let $n \geq 3$ be an odd integer. You are given a string of length $n$, in which each character is a uniformly random element of ${a, b, c}$. \\
The characters are independent of each other. What is the probability that this string is a palindrome? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Discrete Probability (5), Basic Rules of Probability (5.3) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
To guarantee that a string is a palindrome in this case, we have to ensure that the first half of the string matches the second half (but reversed). \\
At each position in the "half of the string", there is a $\frac{1}{3}$ chance that the corresponding character in the other half of the string is the same since there are 3 character options (a, b, c) and only 1 of those can match. \\
Since the string is an odd integer, half of a string would be: $\frac{n-1}{2}$. So if $n = 3$, then half of the string would be $\frac{3-1}{2} = 1$. This makes sense, as we would check if the 1st and last character are the same, and the 2nd character we know would already be the same as itself. \\
This means that the total probability a string is a palindrome is: $(\frac{1}{3})^{n-1/2}$

\subsection{Question 13}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
You are given a uniformly random bitstring of length five. Define the events
$$A = \text{\enquote{the bitstring contains at most four 1's}}$$
$$B = \text{\enquote{the bitstring contains an odd number of 1's}}$$
What is $\Pr(A|B)$ \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Discrete Probability (5), Uniform Probability Spaces (5.4), Conditional Probability (5.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all bitstrings \\
	      $ |S| = 2^5 $
	\item Let's determine B \\
	      We could choose 1 of the 5 positions to be a 1: $ \binom{5}{1} $ \\
	      We could choose 3 of the 5 positions to be a 1: $ \binom{5}{3} $ \\
	      We could choose 5 of the 5 positions to be a 1: $ \binom{5}{5} $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{5}{1} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{5} $ \\
	      $ |B| = 5 + 10 + 1 $ \\
	      $ |B| = 16 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{16}{32} = \frac{1}{2} $
	\item Let's determine $A \cap B $. The only valid cases are where the bitstring has 1 1's or 3 1's: \\
	      We could choose 1 of the 5 positions to be a 1: $ \binom{5}{1} $ \\
	      We could choose 3 of the 5 positions to be a 1: $ \binom{5}{3} $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = \binom{5}{1} + \binom{5}{3} $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 5 + 10 $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 15 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{15}{32} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{\frac{15}{32}}{\frac{1}{2}} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{15}{32} \cdot 2 $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{15}{16} $

\subsection{Question 14}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
You are given two bitstrings $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{77}$ and $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{77}$ of length 77. \\
In both bitstrings, each bit is 0 with probability $3/4$, and 1 with probability $1/4$ (independent of all other bits). \\
Consider the string $a_1 - b_1, a_2 - b_2, \ldots, a_{77} - b_{77}$. \\
What is the probability that each element in this string is non-zero? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Random Variables and Expectation (6), Random Variables (6.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
The difference in string $a-b$ is non-zero at each position only if $a_i$ is 1 and $b_i$ is 0 or $a_i$ is 0 and $b_i$ is 1, for all $1 \leq i \leq 77$ \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if $a_i$ and $b_i$ are different and 0 otherwise \\
$ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4} $ \\
$ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{3}{16} + \frac{3}{16} $ \\
$ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{6}{16} $ \\
$ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{3}{8} $ \\
The probability that each element in the string is non-zero is the probability that each element is different \\
$ \frac{3}{8} \cdot \frac{3}{8} \cdot \text{\ldots} \cdot \frac{3}{8} $ \\
$ = {(\frac{3}{8})}^{77} $

\subsection{Question 15}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
You flip a fair coin four times; these four flips are independent. Define the events
$$A = \text{\enquote{the first two flips result (in this order) in $HT$}} $$
$$B = \text{\enquote{the second and third flips result in $TT$}} $$
Which of the following is correct? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Discrete Probability (5), Independent Events (5.11) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
We'll take a slow and systematic approach to this question
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all possible outcomes \\
	      $ |S| = 2^4 = 16$
	\item Let's determine $A$ \\
	      The first two flips are fixed: $HT$ \\
	      The last 2 flips can be either heads or tails: $ 2^2 = 4 $ \\
	      $ |A| = 1 \cdot 4 = 4 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4} $
	\item Let's determine $B$ \\
	      The second and third flips are fixed: $TT$ \\
	      The first flip can be either heads or tails: $ 2^1 = 2 $ \\
	      The last flip can be either heads or tails: $ 2^1 = 2 $ \\
	      $ |B| = 2 \cdot 2 = 4 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4} $
	\item Let's determine $A \cap B$ \\
	      If the first two flips are $HT$ and the second and third flips are $TT$, then it looks like this: $HTTX$ \\
	      X can either be heads or tails: $ 2^1 = 2 $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 1 \cdot 2 = 2 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's check whether it's independent \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{16} $ \\
Since the two sides are not equal, the events are not independent

\subsection{Question 16}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
You flip a fair coin five times; these five flips are independent. \\
Define the events \\
$A = \text{\enquote{the first three flips result in HHH}}$
$B = \text{\enquote{the number of T in these five flips is at least two}} $
Which of the following is correct? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Discrete Probability (5), Independent Events (5.11)\\
\textbf{Explanation:}
We'll take a slow and systematic approach to this question
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all possible outcomes \\
	      $ |S| = 2^5 = 32$
	\item Let's determine $A$ \\
	      the first three flips are fixed: 1 \\
	      the last 2 flips can be either heads or tails: $ 2^2 = 4 $ \\
	      $ |A| = 1 \cdot 4 = 4 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{4}{32} = \frac{1}{8} $
	\item Let's determine $B$ \\
	      We choose 2 of the 5 positions to be tails: $ \binom{5}{2} $ \\
	      We could also choose 3 of the 5 positions to be tails: $ \binom{5}{3} $ \\
	      We could also choose 4 of the 5 positions to be tails: $ \binom{5}{4} $ \\
	      We could also choose 5 of the 5 positions to be tails: $ \binom{5}{5} $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{5}{2} + \binom{5}{3} + \binom{5}{4} + \binom{5}{5} $ \\
	      $ |B| = 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 $ \\
	      $ |B| = 26 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{26}{32} = \frac{13}{16} $
	\item Let's determine $A \cap B$ \\
	      If the first three flips are heads and you want to have at least two tails, then the two tails must be the last 2 flips \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 1 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{32} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's check whether it's independent \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{32} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{13}{16} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{32} = \frac{13}{128} $ \\
Since the two sides are not equal, the events are not independent

\subsection{Question 17}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
Let $n \geq 1$ be an integer. Consider a uniformly random permutation of the set ${1, 2, 3, \ldots, 2n}$. Define the event
$$A = \text{\enquote{both the first element and the last element in the permutation are even integers}}.$$
What is $\Pr(A)$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Random Variables and Expectation (6), Random Variables (6.1) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let S be the total number of ways to choose a permutation from a set of size $2n$: $2n!$ \\
For the first element and the last element in the permutation are even integers, we have to choose 2 even numbers. There are two ways to rearrange the 2 even numbers: $\binom{n}{2} \cdot 2$ \\
For the remaining positions in the permutation, we have $(2n-2)!$ ways to rearrange these numbers: $(2n-2)!$. \\
$Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} = \frac{\binom{n}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot (2n-2)!}{2n!} = \frac{\frac{n!}{2!(n-2)!} \cdot 2 \cdot (2n-2)!}{2n!} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2n(2n-1)} = \frac{n-1}{2(2n-1)}$

\subsection{Question 18}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
You flip a fair red coin once, and you flip a fair blue coin once, independently of each other. Define the random variables
$$ X = \begin{cases}
		1 \text{ if the red coin flip resulted in heads,}\
		0 \text{ if the red coin flip resulted in tails,}\
	\end{cases}
$$
$$ Y = \begin{cases}
		1 \text{ if the blue coin flip resulted in heads,}\
		0 \text{ if the blue coin flip resulted in tails,}\
	\end{cases}
$$
and $$Z = \text{min}(X,Y)$$. \\
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(Z)$ of the random variable $Z$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Random Variables and Expectation (6), Random Variables (6.1), Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
We can brute force the answer: \\
$ \{ (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) \} $
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For $ (0,0) $, the minimum value is 0 \\
	      There is a $ \frac{1}{4} $ chance of this happening
	\item For $ (0,1) $, the minimum value is 0 \\
	      There is a $ \frac{1}{4} $ chance of this happening
	\item For $ (1,0) $, the minimum value is 0 \\
	      There is a $ \frac{1}{4} $ chance of this happening
	\item For $ (1,1) $, the minimum value is 1 \\
	      There is a $ \frac{1}{4} $ chance of this happening
\end{enumerate}
$ \mathbb{E}(Z) = 0 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 0 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(Z) = 0 + 0 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(Z) = \frac{1}{4} $

\subsection{Question 19}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. Consider a bitstring $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ of length $n$, in which each bit $b_i$ is 0 with probability $1/2$, and 1 with probability $1/2$ (independent of all other bits). \\
Define the random variable $X$ to be the number of indices $i$ with $1 \leq i < n$ for which $b_i \cdot b_{i+1} = 0$. \\
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$? \\
Hint: Use indicator random variables. \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Random Variables and Expectation (6), Expected Values (6.4), Linearity of Expectation (6.5), Indicator Random Variables (6.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if $b_i \cdot b_{i+1} = 0$ and 0 otherwise. This only happens if a pair of consecutive bits contain a 0. \\
$ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \Pr{(b_i = 0 \text{ and } b_{i+1} = 1)} + \Pr{(b_i = 1 \text{ and } b_{i+1} = 0)} + \Pr{(b_i = 0 \text{ and } b_{i+1} = 0)} $ \\
$ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} $ \\
$ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{3}{4} $ \\
Since the last bit has no bit after it, we only take into account the first $n-1$ bits \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 1 \cdot \Pr(X_i = 1) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{3}{4} $ \\

\subsection{Question 20}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
Let $n \geq 2$ be an integer. You are given $n$ beer bottles $B_1, B_2, \ldots, B_n$ and one cider bottle $C$. \\
Consider a uniformly random permutation of these $n+1$ bottles. The positions in this permutation are numbered as $1, 2, 3, \ldots, n+1$. \\
Define the random variable $X$ to be
$$X = \text{the position of the leftmost beer bottle}$$
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Random Variables and Expectation (6), Independent Random Variables (6.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if $C$ is not at position 1 and 2 if $C$ is at position 1 \\
$ \Pr(X_i=1) = \Pr(\text{$B_i$ is at position 1}) = \frac{1}{n+1} $ \\
$ \Pr(X_i=2) = \Pr(\text{$C$ is at position 1}) = \frac{1}{n+1} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{k=2}^{n+1} 1 \cdot \Pr(X_i=1) + 2 \cdot \Pr(X_i=2) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{k=2}^{n+1} 1 \cdot \frac{1}{n+1} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{n+1} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{k=2}^{n+1} \frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{2}{n+1} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = (n+1-2) \cdot (\frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{2}{n+1})$ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{n+1-2+1+2}{n+1} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{n+2}{n+1} $

\subsection{Question 21}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
You are given two independent random variables $X$ and $Y$, where
$$\Pr(X=0) = \Pr(X=1) = \Pr(Y=0) = \Pr(Y=1) = 1/2$$
Define the random variable $Z = X \cdot Y$. Which of the following is correct? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Random Variables and Expectation (6), Independent Random Variables (6.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
For $X$ and $Z$ to be independent, $Pr(X = x \cap Z = z) = Pr(X = x) \cdot Pr(Z = z)$, for all real numbers $x$ and $z$, by definition of independent random variables. \\
If we can find a counterexample, aka where $Pr(X = x \cap Z = z) \neq Pr(X = x) \cdot Pr(Z = z)$, then we know the two are not independent. \\
Let $z = 0$, $x = 0$ and $y = 0$:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $Pr(X = 0) = \frac{1}{2}$, from expression in question
	\item $Pr(Y = 0) = \frac{1}{2}$, from expression in question
	\item $Pr(Z = 0) = Pr(X \cdot Y = 0) = Pr(X = 0 \cap Y = 0) + Pr(X = 0 \cap Y = 1) + Pr(X = 1 \cap Y = 0) = (\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}) + (\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}) + (\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}) = \frac{3}{4}$
	\item $Pr(X = 0 \cap Z = 0) = Pr(X = 0 \cap Y = 0) + Pr(X = 0 \cap Y = 1) = \frac{1}{2}$
\end{enumerate}
Now we check if LHS = RHS for the expression:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $Pr(X = x \cap Z = z) = Pr(X = x) \cdot Pr(Z = z)$
	\item $Pr(X = 0 \cap Z = 0) = Pr(X = 0) \cdot Pr(Z = 0)$
	\item $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4}$
	\item $\frac{1}{2} \neq \frac{3}{8}$
\end{enumerate}
Since LHS is not equal to RHS, then the events $X$ and $Z$ are not independent.

\subsection{Question 22}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
Alexa and Shelly want to play the game of Monopoly. They use the following recursive
algorithm to decide who goes first:
\begin{verbatim}
Algorithm WhoGoesFirst(k):
// k >= 1, the die is fair, and all rolls are independent
Alexa rolls the die, let a be the result;
Shelly rolls the die, let s be the result;
if a > s
then print Alexa goes first;
return k
endif;
if a < s
then print Shelly goes first;
return k
endif;
if a = s
then WhoGoesFirst(k + 1)
endif
\end{verbatim}
The ladies run algorithm WhoGoesFirst(1), i.e., with k = 1. Define the random variable
$X$ to be the value of the output of this algorithm.
What is the expected value $E(X)$ of the random variable $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Random Variables and Expectation (6), Random Variables (6.1), Expected Values (6.4), The Geometric Distribution (6.6) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
In the algorithm, the value of $k$ keeps increasing if the two dice rolls are different. Theoreticaly, this algorithm can go on forever, until the two dice rolls are the same. \\
This is an example of the Geometric Distribution. \\
Let $p$ represent the probability of not ending the recursive algorithm. Using the formula for the expected value for Geometric Distribution we get: \\
$E(X) = \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{6}} = \frac{6}{5}$

\subsection{Question 23}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
Consider the following statement: For any three random variables $X, Y$, and $Z$, \\
$ \mathbb{E}(min(X, Y, Z)) = min(\mathbb{E}(X), \mathbb{E}(Y), \mathbb{E}(Z)) $ \\
Which of the following is correct? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer:} B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems:} Random Variables and Expectation (6), Random Variables (6.1), Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation:} \\
To prove that this statement is false, we need to provide a counterexample: \\
Let X, Y, Z all represent the random variables where $X, Y, Z = 1$ if a coin toss is heads and $X, Y, Z = 0$ if a coin toss is tails. \\
The expected value of $X, Y, Z$ in this case (assuming that $\frac{1}{2}$ chance of hitting heads or tails) is: $E(X) = E(Y) = E(Z) = 0 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 1 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}$. \\
This means that the $min(E(X), E(Y), E(Z) = min(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}) = \frac{1}{2}$ is $\frac{1}{2}$. \\
For the LHS, we need to calculate the expected value for $min(X, Y, Z)$. There are only two possible values in this case: $min(X, Y, Z) = 0$ and $min(X, Y, Z) = 1$
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Pr(min(X, Y, Z) = 1) = every coin has to come up with a heads = $(\frac{1}{2})^{3} = \frac{1}{8}$
	\item Pr(min(X, Y, Z) = 0) = 1 - Pr(min(X, Y, Z) = 1) = $1 - \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}$
	\item $E(min(X, Y, Z)) = 0 \cdot Pr(min(X, Y, Z) = 0) + 1 \cdot Pr(min(X, Y, Z) = 1) = 0 \cdot \frac{7}{8} + 1 \cdot (\frac{1}{8}) = \frac{1}{8}$.
\end{enumerate}
Since $E(min(X, Y, Z)) = \frac{1}{8}$ and $min(E(X), E(Y), E(Z)) = \frac{1}{2}$, the two are not the same, so the statement is false.

\subsection{Question 24}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} \\
Elisa Kazan has successfully completed her second year as President of the Carleton Computer Science Society. \\
In order to celebrate this, Elisa throws a party. \\
She invites 15 students; thus, the total number of students at the party is equal to 16. \\
Elisa has bought an unlimited amount of drinks: 5 types $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5$ of cider and 3 types $B_1, B_2, B_3$ of beer. \\
Each of the 16 students gets 3 drinks; each of these drinks is uniformly, and independently, chosen from the 8 types of drinks. \\
Define the following random variable $X$: \\
$X = \text{the number of students who get exactly 2 ciders}$ \\
What is the expected value $\mathbb{E}(X)$ of the random variable $X$? \\
Hint: Use indicator random variables. \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Random Variables and Expectation (6), Expected Values (6.4), Indicator Random Variables (6.8) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let S be the set of all possibilities = $ |S| = 8^{3} $ \\
Let A be the set of all possibilities where a student gets exactly 2 ciders \\
To get exactly 2 ciders, a student has to have 2 ciders and 1 beer. There are 3 ways to get 2 ciders and a beer: $CBC, BCC, CCB$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Number of ways for combination $CBC$: $\binom{5}{1} \cdot \binom{3}{1} \cdot \binom{5}{1} = 5^2 \cdot 3$
	\item Number of ways for combination $BCC$: $\binom{3}{1} \cdot \binom{5}{1} \cdot \binom{5}{1} = 5^2 \cdot 3$
	\item Number of ways for combination $CCB$: $\binom{5}{1} \cdot \binom{5}{1} \cdot \binom{3}{1} = 5^2 \cdot 3$
\end{enumerate}
Now, we can sum \\
$ \Pr(A) = \Pr( CBC ) + \Pr( BCC ) + \Pr( CCB ) $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = (5^2 \cdot 3) + (5^2 \cdot 3) + (5^2 \cdot 3) $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = 3 \cdot \frac{5^2 \cdot 3}{8^3} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{3^2 \cdot 5^2}{8^3}$ \\
Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable where:
$ 1 \text{ if a student gets exactly 2 ciders} $
$ 0 \text{ otherwise} $
$ \Pr(X_i = 1) = \Pr(A) = \frac{3^2 \cdot 5^2}{8^3}$ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{k=1}^{16} 1 \cdot \Pr(X_i = 1) $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_{k=1}^{16} \frac{3^2 \cdot 5^2}{8^3} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 16 \cdot \frac{3^2 \cdot 5^2}{8^3} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 2^4 \cdot \frac{3^2 \cdot 5^2}{8^3} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^2}{8^3} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot \frac{5^2}{8^3} $

\subsection{Question 1}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings of length 85, in which each character is one of the letters $a, b, c, d$. How many such strings have exactly 5 letters $c$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We choose 5 of the 85 positions to be c: $ \binom{85}{5} $ \\
The remaining 80 positions can be any of the 3 letters: $ 3^{80} $ \\
Thus, the total number of strings is $ \binom{85}{5} \cdot 3^{80} $

\subsection{Question 2}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings of length 85, in which each character is one of the letters $a, b, c, d$.  How many such strings have exactly 15 letters $a$ and exactly 30 letters $d$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
We choose 15 of the 85 positions to be a: $ \binom{85}{15} $ \\
We choose 30 of the 70 remaining positions to be d: $ \binom{70}{30} $ \\
The remaining 40 positions can be any of the 2 letters: $ 2^{40} $ \\
Thus, the total number of strings is $ \binom{85}{15} \cdot \binom{70}{30} \cdot 2^{40} $

\subsection{Question 3}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings of length 85, in which each character is one of the letters $a, b, c, d$.  How many such strings have exactly 15 letters $a$ or exactly 30 letters $d$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's break me down
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A be the set of all strings that have exactly 15 letters a \\
	      We choose 15 of the 85 positions to be a: $ \binom{85}{15} $ \\
	      The remaining 70 positions can be any of the 3 letters: $ 3^{70} $ \\
	      Thus, the total number of strings is $ \binom{85}{15} \cdot 3^{70} $
	\item Let B be the set of all strings that have exactly 30 letters d \\
	      We choose 30 of the 85 positions to be d: $ \binom{85}{30} $ \\
	      The remaining 55 positions can be any of the 3 letters: $ 3^{55} $ \\
	      Thus, the total number of strings is $ \binom{85}{30} \cdot 3^{55} $
	\item Let's determine $A \cap B$ \\
	      We choose 15 of the 85 positions to be a: $ \binom{85}{15} $ \\
	      We choose 30 of the 70 remaining positions to be d: $ \binom{70}{30} $ \\
	      The remaining 40 positions can be any of the 2 letters: $ 2^{40} $ \\
	      Thus, the total number of strings is $ \binom{85}{15} \cdot \binom{70}{30} \cdot 2^{40} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, we can determine $A \cup B$ \\
$ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = \binom{85}{15} \cdot 3^{70} + \binom{85}{30} \cdot 3^{55} - \binom{85}{15} \cdot \binom{70}{30} \cdot 2^{40} $

\subsection{Question 4}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You are given $20$ beer bottles $B_1, B_2, \ldots , B_{20}$ and $50$ cider bottles $C_1, C_2, \ldots , C_{50}$. Consider subsets of these $70$ bottles, that contain exactly $12$ beer bottles (and any number of cider bottles) or exactly $12$ cider bottles (and any number of beer bottles). How many such subsets are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's do this uwu
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A be the set of all subsets that contain exactly 12 beer bottles \\
	      We choose 12 of the 20 beer bottles: $ \binom{20}{12} $ \\
	      We can have any subset of the 50 cider bottles: $ 2^{50} $ \\
	      $|A| = \binom{20}{12} \cdot 2^{50} $
	\item Let B be the set of all subsets that contain exactly 12 cider bottles \\
	      We choose 12 of the 50 cider bottles: $ \binom{50}{12} $ \\
	      We can have any subset of the 20 beer bottles: $ 2^{20} $ \\
	      $|B| = \binom{50}{12} \cdot 2^{20} $
	\item Let's determine $A \cap B$ \\
	      We choose 12 of the 20 beer bottles: $ \binom{20}{12} $ \\
	      We choose 12 of the 50 cider bottles: $ \binom{50}{12} $ \\
	      $|A \cap B| = \binom{20}{12} \cdot \binom{50}{12} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, we can determine $A \cup B$ \\
$ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = \binom{20}{12} \cdot 2^{50} + \binom{50}{12} \cdot 2^{20} - \binom{20}{12} \cdot \binom{50}{12} $

\subsection{Question 5}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} You are given $20$ beer bottles $B_1,B_2, \ldots , B_{20}$ and $50$ cider bottles $C_1,C_2, \ldots , C_{50}$. Consider subsets of these $70$ bottles, that contain at least $3$ beer bottles (and any number of cider bottles). How many such subsets are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all subsets \\
	      $ |S| = 2^{70} $\
	\item Let A be the set of all subsets that contain no beer bottles \\
	      We choose 0 of the 20 beer bottles: $ \binom{20}{0} $ \\
	      We choose any subset of the 50 cider bottles: $ 2^{50} $ \\
	      $ |A| = \binom{20}{0} \cdot 2^{50} = 2^{50} $
	\item Let B be the set of all subsets that contain exactly 1 beer bottle \\
	      We choose 1 of the 20 beer bottles: $ \binom{20}{1} $ \\
	      We choose any subset of the 50 cider bottles: $ 2^{50} $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{20}{1} \cdot 2^{50} = 20 \cdot 2^{50} $
	\item Let C be the set of all subsets that contain exactly 2 beer bottles \\
	      We choose 2 of the 20 beer bottles: $ \binom{20}{2} $ \\
	      We choose any subset of the 50 cider bottles: $ 2^{50} $ \\
	      $ |C| = \binom{20}{2} \cdot 2^{50} = 190 \cdot 2^{50} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, we can determine the number of subsets that contain at least 3 beer bottles \\
$ |S| - |A| - |B| - |C| $ \\
$ = 2^{70} - 2^{50} - 20 \cdot 2^{50} -\binom{20}{2} \cdot 2^{50} $

\subsection{Question 7}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Nick eats lots of bananas. During a period of 7 days, Nick eats a total of 25 bananas. A banana schedule is a sequence of 7 numbers, whose sum is equal to 25, and whose numbers indicate the number of bananas that Nick eats on each day. Three examples of such schedules are $(3, 2, 7, 4, 1, 3, 5)$, $(2, 3, 7, 4, 1, 3, 5)$, and $(3, 0, 9, 4, 1, 0, 8)$. How many banana schedules are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Counting Solutions of Linear Equations (3.9.2) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Yeah, so this is the dividers method. Let's define some stuff I guess \\
Let $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, x_6, x_7$ be the number of bananas Nick eats on each day \\
Now, $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 = 25$ \\
Assuming you have a sea of bananas, let's put dividers to split them off into different days
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $x_1$ is the number of bananas to the left of the first divider
	\item $x_2$ is the number of bananas between the first and second divider
	\item $x_3$ is the number of bananas between the second and third divider
	\item $x_4$ is the number of bananas between the third and fourth divider
	\item $x_5$ is the number of bananas between the fourth and fifth divider
	\item $x_6$ is the number of bananas between the fifth and sixth divider
	\item $x_7$ is the number of bananas to the right of the sixth divider
\end{enumerate}
Now, we have 6 dividers and 25 bananas, so we have 31 objects in total \\
Since each object has a position, we can just move the dividers around to change any x.
We choose 6 spots out of the 31 to be dividers: $ \binom{31}{6} $

I guess we can just think, "total possibilities minus possibilities where both O's are together"
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all possibilities \\
	      We choose 1 position out of the 5 positions for the B: 5 \\
	      We choose 2 position out of the 4 remaining positions for the O: $ \binom{4}{2} $ \\
	      We choose 1 position out of the 3 remaining positions for the G: 3 \\
	      We choose 1 position out of the 2 remaining positions for the E: 2 \\
	      We choose 1 position out of the 1 remaining positions for the R: 1 \\
	      $ |S| = 5 \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 2 $
	\item Let A be the set of all possibilities where both O's are together \\
	      Let's treat the two O's as one letter \\
	      We have 5 letters: $ G, E, R, B, O $ \\
	      We choose 1 position out of the 5 positions for the O's: 5 \\
	      We choose 1 position out of the 4 remaining positions for the G: 4 \\
	      We choose 1 position out of the 3 remaining positions for the E: 3 \\
	      We choose 1 position out of the 2 remaining positions for the R: 2 \\
	      We choose 1 position out of the 1 remaining positions for the B: 1 \\
	      $ |A| = 5! $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's math \\
$ |S| - |A|$ \\
$ = 5 \cdot \binom{4}{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 2 - 5! $

	      We choose 17 of the 25 questions to be correct: $ \binom{25}{17} $ \\
	      The remaining 8 each have 3 possible incorrect answers: $ 3^{8} $ \\
	      $ |A| = \binom{25}{17} \cdot 3^{8} $

$ \Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} $ \\

	      There is only 1 possible end to the bitstring: 111: 1 \\
	      The first 2 bitstrings can be any of the 2 bits: $ 2^2 = 4 $ \\
	      $ |B| = 1 \cdot 4 = 4 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{4}{32} = \frac{1}{8} $
	\item Now, let's determine $ A \cap B $ \\
	      The last 3 bits are 111: 1 \\
	      The first 3 bits are 101 and can't be 110 because the third bit as discussed above is a 1: 1 \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = 1 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{32} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's check whether it's independent \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{32} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{8} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{32} = \frac{1}{32} $ \\
BOOM. THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY. MURICAAAA

\subsection{Question 13}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} A certain terrible, no-good, mean-spirited, awful professor gives his students 250 sample exam questions and then makes his final exam by choosing 25 of these questions uniformly at random.  Student Nika doesn't have much time to study so she chooses 50 (out of 250) random sample exam questions and practices on those.
When Nika writes the exam, what is the expected number of questions that appear on the exam and that Nika has practiced on? \\

	      We can also choose 2 of the red balls: $ \binom{4}{2} $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{5}{2} + \binom{4}{2} = 10 + 6 = 16 $
	\item Let's determine $ A \cap B $
	      We can choose 2 of the red balls: $ \binom{4}{2} $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = \binom{4}{2} = 6 $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let God do the rest
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|} = $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{ \binom{5}{2} + \binom{4}{2} }{ \binom{4}{2} } $

Avatar: The Last Airbender is pretty high tier \\
Let's check for independence \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{4} $ \\
The equation is not false; therefore, they're dependent

Caedrel is the best rat \\
Let's check for independence \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{3}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{5} $ \\
$ \frac{3}{10} = \frac{3}{10} $ \\
Therefore, it is independent

\subsection{Question 20}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} I flip two fair and independent coins. If the first coin comes up tails, you lose \$1. If the second coin comes up heads, you win \$2. $($ Thus, if the first coin comes up tails and the second coins comes up heads, you win $)$. Define the random variable $X$ to be the amount of dollars that you win. What is the expected value of $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Basic Rules of Probability (5.3), Expected Values (6.4) \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X_1$ be the amount of dollars you win if the first coin comes up tails: $-1$ \\
There's a 50/50 chance of it landing tails
$ \Pr(X_1 = -1) = \frac{1}{2} $ \\
Let $X_2$ be the amount of dollars you win if the second coin comes up heads: $2$ \\
There's a 50/50 chance of it landing heads
$ \Pr(X_2 = 2) = \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ E(X) = (-1) \cdot \Pr(X_1 = -1) + 2 \cdot \Pr(X_2 = 2) $ \\
$ E(X) = (-1) \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ E(X) = -\frac{1}{2} + 1 $ \\
$ E(X) = \frac{1}{2} $

\subsection{Question 21}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n \ge 2$ be an integer. Consider a string $c_1, c_2, \ldots , c_n$ of length $n$, in which each character $c_i$ is a uniformly random element of the set $ \{1, 2, 3\} $ (independently of all other characters). Consider the random variable $X$ whose value is the number of indices $i\in \{1,\ldots,n-1\} $ for which the product $c_i\cdot c_{i+1}$ is odd.
What is the expected value $ E(X) $ of the random variable $X$?
Hint: Use indicator random variables.
\textbf{Correct Answer: } \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if the product $c_i\cdot c_{i+1}$ is odd \\
Let A be the event that the product $c_i\cdot c_{i+1}$ is odd \\
Let's draw a multiplication table, baby
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{c c c c}
		           & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} \\
		\textbf{1} & 1          & 2          & 3          \\
		\textbf{2} & 2          & 4          & 6          \\
		\textbf{3} & 3          & 6          & 9          \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
There are 3 odd products: 3, 6, 9 \\
Out of 9 events, the event of an odd product occurs 4 times \\
$ \Pr(A) = \frac{4}{9} $ \\
$ E(X) = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \Pr(X_i = 1) $ \\
$ E(X) = \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \Pr(A) $ \\
$ E(X) = (n-1) \cdot \frac{4}{9} $

\subsection{Question 22}

Experiment: Roll each die once and take the sum of the two rolls.
You repeat this experiment until the sum of the two rolls is equal to 7.
Consider the random variable
\[ X = \text{the number of times you do the experiment.} \]
(This value $X$ includes the experiment in which the sum is $7$ for the first time.)
What is the expected value $ E(X) $ of the random variable $X$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's draw a summation table, dear \\
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c}

		\textbf{1} & 2          & 3          & 4          & 5          & 6          & 7          \\
		\textbf{2} & 3          & 4          & 5          & 6          & 7          & 8          \\
		\textbf{3} & 4          & 5          & 6          & 7          & 8          & 9          \\
		\textbf{4} & 5          & 6          & 7          & 8          & 9          & 10         \\
		\textbf{5} & 6          & 7          & 8          & 9          & 10         & 11         \\
		\textbf{6} & 7          & 8          & 9          & 10         & 11         & 12         \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
As can be seen, there are 6 ways to get a sum of 7: $ \{ (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) \} $ \\
The probability of getting a sum of 7 is $ \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6} $ \\
By the geometric distribution, the expected value is $ \frac{1}{\frac{1}{6}} = 6 $

\subsection{Question 23}

Warning: Hell if I know. Just off the top of my head, I would say no since linearity of expectations only works for addition and subtraction, not multiplication or division

\subsection{Question 24}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n$ and $k$ be integers such that $n$ is even, $n\ge2$, and $1\le k\le n$. The Carleton Computer Science Society (CCSS) is having their annual Christmas Holiday Season Party, which is attended by $n$ students.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $k$ of these $n$ students are politically correct and, thus, refuse to say \emph{Merry Christmas}. Instead, they say \emph{Happy Holidays}.
	\item $n-k$ of these $n$ students do not care about politicial correctness and, thus, they say \emph{Merry Christmas}.
\end{enumerate}
Consider a uniformly random permutation of these $n$ students. The positions in this permutation are numbered as $1, 2, \ldots , n$.
Define the the random variable $X$ as the number of positions $i$ with $1\le i\le n/2$ such that both students at positions $i$ and $2i$ are politically correct.
What is the expected value $ E(X) $ of the random variable $X$?
Hint: Use indicator random variables.
\textbf{Correct Answer: } \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let $X_i$ be 1 if the students at positions $i$ and $2i$ are politically correct
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be all possible combinations \\
	      We choose k positions for the politically correct students: $ \binom{n}{k} $ \\
	      $ |S| = \binom{n}{k} $
	\item Let $X_i=1$ be the event that the students at positions $i$ and $2i$ are politically correct \\
	      2 students at those positions are both politicall correct
	      We choose k-2 positions for the politically correct out of n-2 remaining positions: $ \binom{n-2}{k-2} $ \\
	      $ |X_i=1| = \binom{n-2}{k-2} $
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{X_i=1|}{|S|} $
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{\binom{n-2}{k-2}}{\binom{n}{k}} $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{\frac{ (n-2)! }{ (k-2)! (n-k)! }}{\frac{n!}{k! (n-k)! }} $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{ (n-2)! }{ (k-2)! (n-k)! } \cdot \frac{k! (n-k)!}{n!} $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{ (n-2)! }{ (k-2)! (n-k)! } \cdot \frac{k! (n-k)!}{n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2)!} $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{ 1 }{ (k-2)! (n-k)! } \cdot \frac{k! (n-k)!}{n \cdot (n-1) } $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{ 1 }{ (k-2)! } \cdot \frac{k!}{n \cdot (n-1) } $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{ 1 }{ (k-2)! } \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k-1) \cdot (k-2)! }{n \cdot (n-1) } $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{ 1 }{ 1 } \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k-1) \cdot 1 }{n \cdot (n-1) } $ \\
	      $ \Pr (X_i=1 ) = \frac{k \cdot (k-1) }{n \cdot (n-1) } $
\end{enumerate}
Well, $S_n$ corresponds to $S_{ \frac{n}{2} }$ \\
$S_{n-2}$ corresponds to $S_{\frac{n}{2}-1}$ \\
$S_{n-4}$ corresponds to $S_{\frac{n}{2}-2}$ \\
Half of everyone has a corresponding junior \\
$ E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n/2} \Pr(X_i=1) $ \\
$ E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n/2} \frac{k \cdot (k-1) }{n \cdot (n-1) } $ \\
$ E(X) = \frac{k (k-1) }{n (n-1) } \cdot \frac{n}{2} $ \\

\section{2022 Winter Final}
\subsection{Question 1}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings of length $70$, in which each character is one of the characters $a,b,c,d,e$.  How many such strings have exactly $10$ letters $e$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
First, we choose 10 positions out of the 70 positions to place $e$'s: $ \binom{70}{10} $ \\
Each of the remaining 60 positions can be any of the 4 other letters: $ 4^{60} $ \\
Thus, the final answer is $ \binom{70}{10} \cdot 4^{60} $

\subsection{Question 2}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings of length $70$, in which each character is one of the characters $a,b,c,d,e$.  How many such strings have exactly $5$ letters $a$ and exactly $15$ letters $b$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
First, we choose 5 positions out of the 70 positions to place $a$'s: $ \binom{70}{5} $ \\
Then, we choose 15 positions out of the remaining 65 positions to place $b$'s: $ \binom{65}{15} $ \\
Each of the remaining 50 positions can be any of the 3 other letters: $ 3^{50} $ \\
Thus, the final answer is $ \binom{70}{5} \cdot \binom{65}{15} \cdot 3^{50} $

\subsection{Question 3}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings of length $70$, in which each character is one of the characters $a,b,c,d,e$.  How many such strings have exactly $5$ letters $a$ or exactly $15$ letters $b$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's tear it apart
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let A be the set of all strings with exactly 5 letters $a$ \\
	      We choose 5 positions out of the 70 positions to place $a$'s: $ \binom{70}{5} $ \\
	      Each of the remaining 65 positions can be any of the 4 other letters: $ 4^{65} $ \\
	      $ |A| = \binom{70}{5} \cdot 4^{65} $
	\item Let B be the set of all strings with exactly 15 letters $b$ \\
	      We choose 15 positions out of the 70 positions to place $b$'s: $ \binom{70}{15} $ \\
	      Each of the remaining 55 positions can be any of the 4 other letters: $ 4^{55} $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{70}{15} \cdot 4^{55} $
	\item Let's determine $A \cap B$ \\
	      We choose 5 positions out of the 70 positions to place $a$'s: $ \binom{70}{5} $ \\
	      We choose 15 positions out of the remaining 65 positions to place $b$'s: $ \binom{65}{15} $ \\
	      Each of the remaining 50 positions can be any of the 3 other letters: $ 3^{50} $ \\
	      $ |A \cap B| = \binom{70}{5} \cdot \binom{65}{15} \cdot 3^{50} $
\end{enumerate}
Now, let's get this bread \\
$ |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| $ \\
$ |A \cup B| = \binom{70}{5} \cdot 4^{65} + \binom{70}{15} \cdot 4^{55} - \binom{70}{5} \cdot \binom{65}{15} \cdot 3^{50} $

\subsection{Question 4}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Consider strings of length $70$, in which each character is one of the characters $a,b,c,d,e$.  How many such strings have at least $10$ letters $a$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: }
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ \binom{70}{10} \cdot 5^{60} $
	\item $ \sum_{i=10}^{70} \binom{70}{i} \cdot 5^{70-i} $
	\item $ 5^{70} - \sum_{i=0}^{9} \binom{70}{i} \cdot 4^{70-i} $
	\item $ \binom{70}{10} \cdot 4 ^{60} $
\end{enumerate}
a is wrong because it only counts the number of strings with exactly 10 letters $a$ \\
b is wrong because each repetition repeats saying, \enquote{we hava exactly i a's} BUT it also says that the remaining positions can also be a since it lists all 5 characters being possible candidiates for each remaining position \\
d is wrong because it only counts the numbre of strings with exactly 10 letter $a$'s. You forgot about whith exatly 11 a's, 12 a's, and so on
c is correct because it identifies all possibilities and subtracts the ones that don't have at least 10 a's

\subsection{Question 5}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $S$ be a set of $m+w$ people, $m\ge 10$ of which are men and $w\ge 10$ of which are women.  What does

count? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Warning: It says the answer is \enquote{The numbre 10-element subsets of S that include at least 2 men} and I don't know why

\subsection{Question 6}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} What is the coefficient of $x^{10}y^{20}$ in the expansion of $(2x - 3y)^{30}$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Newton’s Binomial Theorem (3.6.2)  \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
$ (2x - 3y)^{30} $ \\
$ = \sum_{k=10}^{30} \binom{30}{k} \cdot (2x)^{k} \cdot (-3y)^{30-k} $ \\
$ = \binom{30}{10} \cdot (2x)^{10} \cdot (-3y)^{30-10} $ \\
$ = \binom{30}{10} \cdot (2x)^{10} \cdot (-3y)^{20} $ \\
$ = \binom{30}{10} \cdot 2^{10} \cdot (-3)^{20} \cdot x^{10} \cdot y^{20} $ \\
$ = \binom{30}{10} \cdot 2^{10} \cdot (3)^{20} \cdot x^{10} \cdot y^{20} $

is \emph{stupendous} if it contains the substring $\mathrm{CAB}$. For example $\mathrm{ARA\underline{CAB}I}$ and $\mathrm{I\underline{CAB}AAR}$ are both stupendous, but $\mathrm{ARABICA}$ is not.  How many stupendous strings are there? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } Reordering the Letters of a Word (3.9.1)\\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's treat CAB as a single letter \\
That means we have
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 1 CAB
	\item 2 A's
	\item 1 R
	\item 1 I
\end{enumerate}
Since we have 5 entities in total, it means we have 5 positions \\
We choose 1 position out of the 5 positions to place CAB: $ \binom{5}{1} = 5 $ \\
We choose 2 positions out of the remaining 4 positions to place A's: $ \binom{4}{2} = 6 $ \\
We choose 1 position out of the remaining 2 positions to place R: $ \binom{2}{1} = 2 $ \\
We choose 1 position out of the remaining 1 position to place I: $ \binom{1}{1} = 1 $ \\
Thus, the final answer is $ 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 60 $

\subsection{Question 8}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n\ge 1$ be an integer and let $S_n$ be the number of ways in which $n$ can be written as a sum of $1$'s and $3$'s, in which the order of the terms matters.  For example, $S_4=3$ because
\[ 4 = 1+1+1+1 = 1+3 = 3+1 \enspace . \]
Which of the following is true, for any integer $n\ge 4$:
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\

\subsection{Question 10}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} The function $ T: N \to N$ is defined recursively as follows:
\[
	T(n) =
	\begin{cases}
		3                 & \text{if $n=0$}    \\
		2\cdot T(n-1) + 3 & \text{if $n\ge 1$}
	\end{cases}
\]
Which of the following is true, for all $n\ge 0$? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } C \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Let's just plug in some values and see what happens \\
$ T(0) = 3 $ \\
$ T(1) = 2 \cdot 3 + 3 = 9 $ \\
$ T(2) = 2 \cdot 9 + 3 = 21 $ \\
$ T(3) = 2 \cdot 21 + 3 = 45 $ \\
Now, we see which one matches
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $T(n) = 3n$ \\
	      $T(1) = 3 \neq 3 \cdot 1 = 3$
	\item $T(n) = 2^{n+1} + 1$ \\
	      $T(1) = 9 \neq 2^{1+1} + 1 = 5$
	\item $T(n) = 3(2^{n+1} - 1)$ \\
	      $T(1) = 3(2^2 - 1) = 3(4 - 1) = 9$ \\
	      $T(2) = 3(2^3 - 1) = 3(8 - 1) = 21$
	\item $T(n) = 2(3^{n+1} - 1)$ \\
	      $T(1) = 2(9-1) = 16$
	\item $T(n) = 3^{n+1}$ \\
	      $T(1) = 9$ \\
	      $T(2) = 27$
\end{enumerate}
Since only c matches, the answer is c

\end{table}
4, 8, and 12 are all divisible by 4
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 4 comes up 3 times \\
	      $ \Pr(D_1+D_2=4) = \frac{3}{36} $
	\item 8 comes up 5 times \\
	      $ \Pr(D_1+D_2=8) = \frac{5}{36} $
	\item 12 comes up 1 time \\
	      $ \Pr(D_1+D_2=12) = \frac{1}{36} $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr((D_1+D_2)\bmod 4 = 0) $ \\
$ = \Pr(D_1+D_2=4) + \Pr(D_1+D_2=8) + \Pr(D_1+D_2=12) $
$ = \frac{3}{36} + \frac{5}{36} + \frac{1}{36} $
$ = \frac{9}{36} $
$ = \frac{1}{4} $

\subsection{Question 13}

whose entries are all in the set $\{2,3,\ldots,12\}$.  Let $k$ be an integer in $\{0,\ldots,n\}$. What is the probability that $S$ contains exactly $k$ many $5$'s? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\

\end{tabular}
First, we choose which $k$ of the $n$ pairs will contain a 5: $ \binom{n}{k} $ \\
As can be seen $ \Pr(D_i+D_{i+1}=5) = \frac{4}{36} = \frac{1}{9} $ \\
The remaining sum roles can be anything but 5: $ {(\frac{8}{9})}^{n-k} $ \\
Thus, the final answer is $ \binom{n}{k} \cdot {(\frac{1}{9})}^{k} \cdot {(\frac{8}{9})}^{n-k} $

\textbf{Correct Answer: } D \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
First, let's calculate $ \Pr(A \cap B) $
Since $A$ and $B$ are independent, $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{1}{6} $ \\
Now, let's calculate $ \Pr(A \cup B) $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) - \Pr(A \cap B) $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cup B) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{6} $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cup B) = \frac{2}{6} + \frac{3}{6} - \frac{1}{6} $ \\

ngl, I have no idea how the right answer is the right answer. Let's just do this and let the math take us to heaven or hell
Since they're standing in a cirlce, the last person has the first person to their right. That means we consider every single person
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let S be the set of all possible coin tosses for $p_i$ and his/her neighbours \\
	      $ |S| = 2^3 = 8 $
	\item Let A be the event that $p_i$ says Huzzah when they get a head
	      $p_i$ gets a head: 1 \\
	      $p_{i-1}$ must get a tail: 1 \\
	      $p_{i+1}$ must get a tail: 1 \\
	      $ |A| = 1 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{1}{8} $
	\item Let B be the event that $p_i$ says Huzzah when they get a tail
	      $p_i$ gets a tail: 1 \\
	      $p_{i-1}$ must get a head: 1 \\
	      $p_{i+1}$ must get a head: 1 \\
	      $ |B| = 1 $ \\
	      $ \Pr(B) = \frac{1}{8} $
	\item A and B are mutually exclusive, so let's just calculate their union
	      $ \Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cup B) = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cup B) = \frac{2}{8} $ \\
	      $ \Pr(A \cup B) = \frac{1}{4} $
\end{enumerate}
$E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 \cdot \Pr(A \cup B) $ \\
$E(X) = n \cdot \Pr(A \cup B) $ \\
$E(X) = n \cdot \frac{1}{4} $ \\

$\Pr(X=1) = \frac{1}{36} $ \\
$ \Pr(Y=12) $ is asking for rolls with a sum of 12: $ (6,6) $ \\
$ \Pr(Y=12) = \frac{1}{36} $ \\
$ \Pr(X=1 \cap Y=12) $ is asking for rolls that have max values of 1 yet produce a sum of 12. This is impossible. 1 and 1 don't make 12, so the probability is 0
$ \Pr(X=1 \cap Y=12) = 0$
As you can see, it isn't independence day

\subsection{Question 22}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $D_1$ and $D_2$ be the result of tossing a $6$-sided die twice. Define the random variables
\[  X=2\cdot D_1 \]
and
\[ Y=
	\begin{cases}
		1 & \text{if $D_1+D_2=7$}         \\
		0 & \text{otherwise.}  \enspace .
	\end{cases}
\]
Which of the following is true? \\
\textbf{Correct Answer: } A \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
Warning: no idea. I tried but idk
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Let's make a table for the double value of $D_1$
	      \begin{table}[h!]
		      \centering
		      \begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c}
			                 & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} & \textbf{5} & \textbf{6} \\
			      \textbf{1} & 2          & 4          & 6          & 8          & 10         & 12         \\
		      \end{tabular}
	      \end{table}
	\item Let's make the other table
	      \begin{table}[h!]
		      \centering
		      \begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c}
			                 & \textbf{1} & \textbf{2} & \textbf{3} & \textbf{4} & \textbf{5} & \textbf{6} \\
			      \textbf{1} & 0          & 0          & 0          & 0          & 0          & 1          \\
			      \textbf{2} & 0          & 0          & 0          & 0          & 1          & 0          \\
			      \textbf{3} & 0          & 0          & 0          & 1          & 0          & 0          \\
			      \textbf{4} & 0          & 0          & 1          & 0          & 0          & 0          \\
			      \textbf{5} & 0          & 1          & 0          & 0          & 0          & 0          \\
			      \textbf{6} & 1          & 0          & 0          & 0          & 0          & 0          \\
		      \end{tabular}
	      \end{table}
\end{enumerate}
It's easy to prove stuff is dependent. I don't actually know how to prove it's independence day

\subsection{Question 23}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Is the following statement true or false?
\begin{quote}
	For any random variable $X$, $ E(X^2) = E(X) \cdot E(X) $.
\end{quote}
\textbf{Correct Answer: } B \\
\textbf{Relevant Theorems: } \\
\textbf{Explanation: } \\
No, what you're talking about is linearity of expectations, which only works for sums and differences, not products and quotients
Thus, the statement is false

\subsection{Question 24}
\textbf{Plaintext Question:} Let $n\ge 2$ be an integer and let $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ be a random permutation of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$.  Define the random variable
\[  I=\min\left(\{n+1\}\cup\{i\ge 2:x_i > x_1\}\right) \enspace .
\]
What is $ E(I)$?
\textbf{This question has no correct answer. The correct answer is $1+H_n$.  All students received a mark for this.}
Warning: I have never seen this notation in my life
