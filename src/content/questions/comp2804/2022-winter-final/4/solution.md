a is wrong because it only counts the number of strings with exactly 10 letters $a$

b is wrong because each repetition repeats saying, \enquote{we hava exactly i a's} BUT it also says that the remaining positions can also be a since it lists all 5 characters being possible candidiates for each remaining position

d is wrong because it only counts the numbre of strings with exactly 10 letter $a$'s. You forgot about whith exatly 11 a's, 12 a's, and so on

c is correct because it identifies all possibilities and subtracts the ones that don't have at least 10 a's
