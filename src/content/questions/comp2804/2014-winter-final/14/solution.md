	The set of outcomes for $C$ is $(HTT)$. <br/>
	the coin has a 50% chance of landing heads followed by two 50% chances of landing tails. <br/>
	The probability of $C$ is $ Pr(C) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{8}$
</ul>

The probability that the sequence contains at most two $T$s is the \sum of the probabilities of events $A$, $B$, and $C$:

$(Pr(\text{at most 2} T)) $

$ = Pr(A) + Pr(B) + Pr(C) $

$ = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{7}{8}$
