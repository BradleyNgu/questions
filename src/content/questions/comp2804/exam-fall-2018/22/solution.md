We're looking for the number of times Tri eats when running the algorithm, which is akin to saying \enquote{how many times do we call TriIsHungry?} \\
The probability that we call TriIsHungry again is $ \frac{5}{12} $ since we only stop when we get Banh Xeo \\
Geometric Distrbution tells us that the expected number of times until something happens is $ \frac{1}{\Pr} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{1}{\frac{5}{12}} $ \\
$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \frac{12}{5} $
