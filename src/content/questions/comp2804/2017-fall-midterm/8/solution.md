Placing 4 points furthest from each other creates a square.
The distance between the two points is $ 17 $, which is just the length of side 
Now, we place 4 points in each corner of the square. Place the fifth point in the middle of the square. 
Now, let's calculate the distance between the middle point and any other point. 
$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $
$ {( \frac{1}{2}17)}^2 + {( \frac{1}{2}17)}^2 = c^2 $
$ \frac{1}{4}17^2 + \frac{1}{4}17^2 = c^2 $
$ \frac{1}{2}17^2 = c^2 $
$ sqrt{ \frac{1}{2}17^2} = c $
$ sqrt{ \frac{1}{2}}17 = c$
