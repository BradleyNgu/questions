A = At least two $ a $'s 
B = No $ a $'s 
Each position has 4 choices: $ b, c, d, e $ 
There are 12 positions, so there are $ 4^{12} $ ways to choose the characters. 
C = Exactly 1 $ a $ 
There are 12 positions to choose from, and 1 of them must be $ a $. 
The other 11 positions can be any of the 4 characters: $ b, c, d, e $ 
$ |C| = 12 \cdot 4^{11} $
$ |A| = text{All Possible Strings} - text{No $ a $'s} - text{Exactly 1 $ a $} $ 
$ |A| = 5^{12} - 4^{12} - 12 \cdot 4^{11} $
