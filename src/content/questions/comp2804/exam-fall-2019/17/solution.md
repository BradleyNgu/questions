<ul>
<li> Let's determine $S$ \\
$ |S| = 10 $
	<li> Let's determine $A$ \\
There are 5 even numbers: 5 \\
$ |A| = 5 $
	      $ \Pr(A) = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} $
	<li> Let's determine $B$ \\
There are 5 numbers between 1 and 5: 5 \\
$ |B| = 5 $ \\
$ \Pr(B) = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} $
	<li> Let's determine $A \cap B$ \\
There are 2 numbers that are both even and between 1 and 5, which are 2 and 4: 2 \\
$ |A \cap B| = 2 $ \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5} $

Let's check for independence \\
$ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} $ \\
$ \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{4} $ \\
The equation is not false; therefore, they're dependent
