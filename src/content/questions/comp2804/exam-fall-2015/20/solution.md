Let $X_i$ be 1 if the 3 coin flips result in exactly 2 heads and 0 otherwise. 
The probability of getting exactly 2 heads is $ Pr(X_i = 1) = frac{3}{8} $ 
Since $X_i$ represents 3 coin flips, we need to divide by 3 to get the expected value of 1 coin flip. 
$ E(X_i) = frac{1}{3} cdot frac{3}{8} $ 
$ E(X_i) = frac{1}{8} $ 
Now, we use geometric distribution to find the expected value of $X$. 
$ E(X) = frac{1}{frac{1}{8}} = 8 $
