We can use the pigeonhole principle. To guarantee that at least two of them have the same student number, we need to have one more student than the number of possible student numbers.
There are $ 10 cdot 9 cdot 8 cdot 7 cdot 6 $ possible student numbers.
We can rewrite this asldots
$ frac{10 cdot 9 cdot 8 cdot 7 cdot 6}{10 cdot 9 cdot 8 cdot 7 cdot 6} cdot 1 $
$ = frac{10 cdot 9 cdot 8 cdot 7 cdot 6}{10 cdot 9 cdot 8 cdot 7 cdot 6 cdot 5 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot 1}{5 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdot 2 cdot 1} $
$ = frac{10!}{5!} $
With the pigeonhole principle, we need to have $ frac{10!}{5!} + 1 $ students to guarantee that at least two of them have the same student number.
