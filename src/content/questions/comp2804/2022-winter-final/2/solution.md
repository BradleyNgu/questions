First, we choose 5 positions out of the 70 positions to place $a$'s: $ \binom{70}{5} $

Then, we choose 15 positions out of the remaining 65 positions to place $b$'s: $ \binom{65}{15} $

Each of the remaining 50 positions can be any of the 3 other letters: $ 3^{50} $

Thus, the final answer is $ \binom{70}{5} \cdot \binom{65}{15} \cdot 3^{50} $
