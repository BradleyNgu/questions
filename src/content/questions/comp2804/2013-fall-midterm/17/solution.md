Let A be the event that we get a question correct

We have 4 options and only one of them is correct $ \Pr(A) = \frac{1}{4} $

We're basically trying to replicate this success 17 times:

$ \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(A) \cdot \ldots \cdot \Pr(A) = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot ... \cdot \frac{1}{4} $

The probability of getting all 17 questions correct is $ \frac{1}{4^{17}} $
