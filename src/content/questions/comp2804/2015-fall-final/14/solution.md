Let B be the event that no student's birthday is on December 21.
The first student has a birthday on any day except December 21: $ \frac{364}{365} $
The second student has a birthday on any day except December 21: $ \frac{364}{365} $
...
The $n$th student has a birthday on any day except December 21: $ \frac{364}{365} $
$ Pr(B) = {left( \frac{364}{365} right)}^{n} $
$ Pr(A) = 1 - Pr(B) $
$ Pr(A) = 1 - {left( \frac{364}{365} right)}^{n} $
