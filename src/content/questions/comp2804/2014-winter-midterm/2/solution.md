<ul>
    <li> First, we can either put the boys on the left side and girls on the right side or vice versa. <br/>
    This doubles the number of ways: $2$
    <li> Then, we can arrange the boys in their section. <br/>
    The first boy can be in any of the 9 spots in the boys section. <br/>
    The second boy can be in any of the 8 remaining spots in the boys section. <br/>
    We can continue this pattern until the last boy. <br/>
    There are $9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$ ways to arrange <br/>
    We can rewrite this as $9! $ 
    <li> In the girls section, we can do the same thing. <br/>
    The first girl can be in any of the 15 spots in the girls section. <br/>
    The second girl can be in any of the 14 remaining spots in the girls section. <br/>
    We can continue this pattern until the last girl. <br/>
    There are $15 \cdot 14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$ ways to arrange <br/>
    We can rewrite this as $15! $
</ul>
Thus, the total number of ways is $2 \cdot 9! \cdot 15! $
