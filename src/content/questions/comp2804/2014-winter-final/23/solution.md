<ul>
<li> Let S be the set of all pairs of dice rolls. 
The size of S is the number of outcomes when rolling a pair of dice: $ |S| = 6 times 6 = 36 $
	<li> Let A be the set of all pairs of dice rolls that sum to 7. 
	      The set of A is $ { (1,6), (2,5), (3,4), (4,3), (5,2), (6,1) } $ 
	      The size of A is the number of outcomes in $A$: $ |A| = 6 $
$ Pr(A) = \frac{|A|}{|S|} = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6} $
</ul>
The Geometric Distribution is used to model the number of trials needed to achieve the first success in repeated independent Bernoulli trials. 
The expected value of a Geometric Distribution with probability of success $ p $ is given by $ \frac{1}{p} $. 
Therefore, the expected value of $ X $ is $ \frac{1}{ \frac{1}{6}} = 6 $.
