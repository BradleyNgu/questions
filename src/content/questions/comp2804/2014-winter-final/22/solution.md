Let $X_i$ be 1 if the current coin flip and the next coin flip are $HT$, and 0 otherwise.

$ \sum\_{i=1}^{9} 3 X_i $

The probability of getting HT is $ Pr(X_i = 1) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} $

Since we are determining the current coin flip and the next coin flip, we do not measure the final coin flip and a non-existant next coin flip.

Because we flip the coin 10 times, we can get 9 HTs.

$ 27 \cdot \frac{1}{4} $

$ = \frac{27}{4} $
