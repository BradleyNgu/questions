\begin{enumerate}
\item Let A = Event that $x$ is even \\
A occurs when we choose an even number from the set ${2, 4, 6, 8, 10}$ \\
$ |A| = 5 $
	\item Let B = Event that $x$ is divisible by 3 \\
B occurs when we choose a number from the set ${3, 6, 9}$ \\
$ |B| = 3 $
	\item Let $A \cap B$ = Event that $x$ is even and divisible by 3 \\
$ |A \cap B| = 1 $
\end{enumerate}
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|B|} $ \\
$ \Pr(A|B) = \frac{1}{3} $
