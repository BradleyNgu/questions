1. Let's determine $ \Pr(A) $

   A occurs when $a_1$ is odd. There are 3 odd numbers in the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$, so there are 3 ways for $a_1$ to be odd.

   Therefore, $ \Pr(A) = \frac{3}{5} $

2. Let's determine $ \Pr(B) $

   B occurs when $a_5$ is even. There are 2 even numbers in the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$, so there are 2 ways for $a_5$ to be even.

   Therefore, $ \Pr(B) = \frac{2}{5} $

3. Let's determine $ \Pr(A \cap B) $

   $A \cap B$ occurs when $a_1$ is odd and $a_5$ is even.

   We choose 1 of the 3 odd numbers for $a_1$: $\binom{3}{1} = 3$.

   We choose 1 of the 2 even numbers for $a_5$: $\binom{2}{1} = 2$.

   Therefore, $|A \cap B| = 3 \cdot 2 = 6$.

   Therefore, $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \frac{6}{5!} = \frac{1}{20} $

4. Profit

   Check if $A$ and $B$ are independent.

   $ \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B) $

   $ \frac{1}{20} = \frac{3}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{5} $

   $ \frac{1}{20} = \frac{6}{25} $

   Since $ \frac{1}{20} \neq \frac{6}{25} $, $A$ and $B$ are not independent.
