1. Determine indicator random variable

   Let $X_i$ be 1 if both questions are marked by Alexa and Zoltan, so that an assignment has been marked by both Alexa and Zoltan

   The probability that Alexa marks the first question is p

   The probability that Zoltan marks the first question is q

$ \Pr(X_i=1) = p \cdot q $

1. Profit

$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum\_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{E}(X_i) $

$ \mathbb{E}(X) = \sum\_{i=1}^{n} p \cdot q $

$ \mathbb{E}(X) = n \cdot p \cdot q $
