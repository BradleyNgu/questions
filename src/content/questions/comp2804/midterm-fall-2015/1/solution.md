First, we choose 2 of the n students to be Vice-Presidents. There are $binom{n}{2}$ ways to do this. 
Then, we choose 5 of the remaining n-2 students to be on the Advisory Board. There are $binom{n-2}{5}$ ways to do this. 
Finally, we choose one of the remaining n-7 students to be the President. There are $binom{n-7}{1}=(n-7) ways to do this. $ 
Thus, the number of ways to choose the Board of Directors is $binom{n}{2} cdot binom{n-2}{5} cdot (n-7)$
