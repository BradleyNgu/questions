Let's use dividers to separate the bananas eaten per day. 
We have 75 bananas and 4 dividers.
<ul>
<li> $x_1$ represents the number of bananas to the left of the first divider
<li> $x_2$ represents the number of bananas between the first and second dividers
<li> $x_3$ represents the number of bananas between the second and third dividers
<li> $x_4$ represents the number of bananas between the third and fourth dividers
<li> $x_5$ represents the number of bananas to the right of the fourth divider
</ul>
Since we have added positions for dividers to the 75 bananas, we have 79 positions in total. 
We need to choose 4 positions for the dividers: $ binom{79}{4} $
