Let's break it down
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let A = 3 blue balls \\
We choose 3 of the 4 blue balls $ \binom{4}{3} $ \\
The first red ball has 3 possible positions, second has 2 possible remaining positions, and the third has 1 remaining possible position: $ 3! $ \\
$ |A| = \binom{4}{3} \times 3! $ \\
$ |A| = 4 \times 3! $ \\
$ |A| = 24 $
	\item Let B = 3 red balls \\
	      We choose 3 of the 5 red balls: $ \binom{5}{3} $ \\
	      The first blue ball has 3 possible positions, second has 2 possible remaining positions, and the third has 1 remaining possible position: $ 3! $ \\
	      $ |B| = \binom{5}{3} \times 3! $ \\
	      $ |B| = 10 \times 3! $ \\
	      $ |B| = 60 $
\end{enumerate}
The total number of arrangements is the sum of the arrangements in sets $ A \cup B $: \\
$ |A| + |B| $ \\
$ = 24 + 60 $ \\
$ = 84 $
