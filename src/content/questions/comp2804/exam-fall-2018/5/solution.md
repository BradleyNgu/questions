Let's break down which ones are right and which ones are wrong
\begin{enumerate}
\item The number of subsets of $S$ that are non-empty. \\
This phrase takes into account subsets of size 1 but the equation starts at 2. This is wrong.
\item The number of subsets of $S$ that contain at least two elements. \\
So this one looks right. We start off at subsets of size at least 2 and go all the way up to subsets of size $n$. This is correct.
\item The number of bitstrings of length $n$ that contain at least one 0. \\
So this one is wrong because it doesn't contain bitstrings that contain one 0
\item The number of bitstrings of length $n$ that contain at least three 0's. \\
This one is wrong because it doesn't contain bitstrings that contain at two 0's
\end{enumerate}
