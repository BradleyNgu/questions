We can use the stars and bars method to solve this problem.

Imagine the first block composes $ x_1 $ stars, the second block composes $ x_2 $ stars, and so on.

We need to insert 3 bars to separate the 4 blocks.

Because we're inserting 3 bars, we add 3 extra positions

Now, stars to the left of the first bar represent $ x_1 $, stars between the first and second bars represent $ x_2 $, and so on.

The total number of positions is $ 777 + 3 = 780 $

Now we choose 3 positions out of 780 to place the bars

The number of solutions is $ \binom{780}{3} $
