Let S be all possible strings of length 14: $ |S| = 26^{14} $ \\
Let B be the event that the string contains at no vowels \\
The first character can be any of the 21 consonants: 21 \\
The second character can be any of the 21 consonants: 21 \\
\ldots \\
The 14th character can be any of the 21 consonants: 21 \\
$ |B| = 21^{14} $ \\
$ \Pr(B) = \frac{21^{14}}{26^{14}} $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = 1 - \Pr(B) $ \\
$ \Pr(A) = 1 - \frac{21^{14}}{26^{14}} $
